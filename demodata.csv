3 hours ago,clHjVH6sgDY,Bhavish Aggarwal Made a Big Mistake - Indian Startup News 230,backstagewithmillionaires,"this one tweet cost bagwell's Ola electric 3,500 CR rupees as their stock price dropped by 9% in a single day so it all started on Sunday morning when Bish posted a simple picture of ola's gigafactory on X and this was just a normal photo nothing out of the ordinary but then comedian Kunal kumra who has 2.4 million followers on X posted a response That Shook things up so kumra shared a photo of a bunch of Ola electric scooters just sitting outside of an Oli electric service center collecting dust waiting to be repaired he pointed out that these scooters are a Lifeline for daily wage workers and asked his followers to share their experiences with Ola electric scooters and that's when things blew up so hundreds of people flooded their replies sharing their problems with Ola electric scooters but instead of addressing these complaints Mavish fired back he accused kamra of writing a paid tweet against Ola and it didn't stop there Mish went on to call KRA a failed comedian and even offered him a job at ola's service centers promising to pay him more than his flop shows instead of taking responsibility and assuring his customers that things would get better Bish seemed more interested in a public fight with kunam and here's the thing these service center issues aren't new people have been complaining about Ola service for a while now there are videos of frustrating customers who are very upset about the situation at least one instance of someone burning their scooter and one person went so far as to burn down an Ola showroom and Reuters actually did a report last year highlighting ola's service delays and more recently was revealed that Ola receives over 880,000 complaints every single month since last year while complaints have increased ola's service centers have barely grown from 400 to 500 at ola's Big sunk gulp event they announced new motorcycles and flashy AI initiatives but there wasn't any mention of expanding their service network but then finally last month Bish did announce plans to double their service enters from 500 to 1,000 by the end of this year and that brought some relief to Ola customers but we'll have to wait and see if Bish can actually deliver on This Promise because so far rather than being accountable it seems like Bish has just chosen the path of arrogance he's focusing on arguing with people like Kunal who are trying to highlight the issue trying to shine a light on something so that the situation will get better it's also worth noting that the ministry of Road Transport and highways has actually stepped in they are launching a formal investigation asking Ola electric to provide a detailed report given the number of complaints from customers Ola electric is also under scrutiny right now from the central consumer protection authority which issued a show cause notice over potential consumer rights violations pointing out issues with the company's ability to handle customer Grievances and offer transparent service the company now has 15 days to respond and provide documents and meanwhile the ministry's involvement may put even more pressure on the company because there have been over 10,000 complaints filed on the National Consumer helpline in the last year so it seems like things have definitely started to come to a head this is a pretty interesting moment for the company and I'm curious to know your thoughts can Bish and Ola electric make a comeback or are we potentially even witnessing the beginning of the end for Ola electric let me know in a comment down below all right next up in the news India has lost one of the most beloved industrialists and philanthropists ranata a man who was respected and admired by pretty much everybody in the country and while most people know him for his work with Tata group and his philanthropy there is a side of ratan Tata that some of you might not know about and that's being an active angel investor in India's startup ecosystem for a decade ranata quietly invested in more than 40 Indian startups and it all started back in 2014 with SNAP deal now snap deal story definitely didn't go as planned and probably not how he would have hoped as an investor but here's the thing his investment style was far from typical unlike most investors who are just looking for an Roi he wasn't really doing this for his own wealth instead his reason for investing was a lot deeper when Kunal Beale one of snap Deal's Founders asked R why he invested he said something pretty interesting he explained that after retiring he realized that there was a whole new world out there the digital world he saw the massive potential of online marketplaces driven by handheld devices and he predicted that these devices Would One Day become the virtual retail stores of India ratan Tata realized that India's future was a digital one and this prediction ended up being spoton but it didn't stop with SNAP deal he continued supporting young Indian startup Founders and some of the startups that he invested in actually went on to change the face of digital India just look at this list of some of the most successful Investments that he made over the years and today we're not just grateful for what he built at T we're also thankful for the opportunities that he created for countless entrepreneurs across the country all right next up in the news and talking about creating opportunities for entrepreneurs let's talk about Shark Tank India and things are getting pretty interesting for this upcoming season season 4's promo is out and we have a new shark joining the season Kunal beel the co-founder of snap gill who I just finished talking about is actually joining as a new shark replacing Z dindra goel so what's the story behind this switch well it's not just a casual replacement it turns out the pinther is actually being kicked off of Shark Tank India and the reason is swiggy according to debendra himself swiggy is sponsoring season 4 of shark Dan India and one of the conditions there was that debendra wouldn't be on the show so it seems like swiggy didn't want to have a direct competitor like zato to have screen time during their big sponsorship which makes perfect sense but it's also kind of a bit of a I don't know Plain Dirty I guess kicking him off of the show uh I think it's going to upset some people and one report says that swiggy could be shelling out anywhere between 40 and 60 crupes for this sponsorship deal that is a lot of money but there's a good reason behind it swiggy is prepping for their upcoming IPO and shark Dany could be a brilliant marketing platform to get retail investors hyped up but this isn't the only thing swiggy is doing before their IPO they also just recently launched bolt a 10-minute food delivery service and they're also rolling out an electric Fleet to manage larger orders just like zomato did all right next up in the news the government of India is gearing up to launch a new production link incentive scheme to promote the manufacturing of indigenous drones in India but here's the thing this isn't the first attempt at PL schemes for drones back in 2021 the government introduced its first PL scheme for drones allocating 120 Cotes to be dispersed over 3 years starting from FY 2122 but as it turns out the first scheme didn't go exactly as planned the civil aviation secretary recently admitted that the initial P scheme was a bit too complicated especially for startups and msmes the process was bogged down with inefficiencies making it difficult for companies to really take advantage of the scheme and so this time the government is planning to simplify the process making it more efficient in terms of implementation and documentation and according to a discussion paper the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and industry has suggested the government increased the outlay to 1,000 crots and that is a big jump but it could be exactly what's needed to give India's drone industry the Boost that it needs all right now let's move into the funny News segment for today's video this week Indians startups raised a total of 96.7 million and even though it's higher than last week this is still way below the trend line for the second consecutive week so now let's look at some of the companies that have raised funds this week the first one I want to talk about is buet based habber and they're developing an AI driven industrial robot that is automating processes like sample collection measurement and real time analysis at factories and they've raised $38 million in their series C and then after that we have Hyderabad Bas space deck startup XD link space Labs that designs builds and deploys cost effective satellites for their clients and they've raiseed $7 million in their seed round after that we have B based bioprime eggy Solutions which is an egri biotech startup that's making crops more climate resistant by developing products based on biomolecules and they've raised $6 million in their series a round next we have new Dil based nion Tech which is using crowdsourced video data from dash cams and mobile devices installed in vehicles to monitor traffic conditions detect violations and analyze driver behavior and they're providing real-time insights using AI to come compies to improve their Fleet operations and make the road safer for everybody and they've raised $2 million in their pre-series a round and then finally we have gurram based AI Healthcare startup GV which is using AI to provide real-time personalized diagnosis treatment recommendations and health reports by integrating various Medical Data sources and they're actually the first startup in India to get investment from Andrew en's AI fund and the amount that they've raised remains undisclosed all right that is all the startup news that I have for you guys this week I really hope you enjoyed the video and if you get a chance go check out the video that we recently made about the top 10 startups from utron at the time me filming this video it has less than 5,000 views and I would love more people to see it to find out what's going on in that state and all the startup action that's happening there

2/7 It all started with comedian Kunal Kamra sharing a pic of neglected Ola scooters waiting for repairs. His post led to a flood of customer complaints about Ola's service. Talk about a PR nightmare! 🚨

3/7 Instead of addressing these legitimate concerns, Ola's CEO Mavish went on the offensive, throwing insults at Kamra. This only made things worse! 🥴 It’s like he waved a red flag in front of angry customers instead of calming the storm.

4/7 Here’s the kicker: Ola has over 880,000 complaints a month! Their service centers barely expanded, and many customers are understandably frustrated. It's not just a few unhappy people—this is a growing crisis! 

5/7 Even the Indian Ministry of Road Transport stepped in, asking Ola for a detailed report on these complaints. Talk about putting the heat on! 🔥 The stakes are high, and Ola needs to step up their game fast.

6/7 Can Ola Electric bounce back from this mess? Or are we seeing the beginning of something more serious? 💭 The company's future depends on how they handle customer grievances and responsively expand their service network.

7/7 It’s a fascinating moment to watch! What’s your take? Do you think Ola can regain trust, or is this the start of their downfall? Let me know your thoughts!"
16 hours ago,j4-HA91MgUw,AI News: Futuristic Robotaxis & AI That Can Taste!,mreflow,"compared to other weeks it's been a relatively slow week in the world of AI however we got some really cool stuff out of Tesla and their we robot event that happened and there was also a ton of advancements in the world of AI video so let's just Dive Right In starting with the Tesla wi robot event where Elon showed off some of the things they've been working on over at Tesla now the event started off with Elon getting into an autonomous vehicle and driving around the lot here there is nobody driving the car that's just Elon riding in the front seat as it drives him over to I guess the stage where he's presenting on they have this moment where he drives around the corner and as he drives around the corner some bicycles right out in front of them and the car knows to stop to show that it's actually aware of all the stuff that's happening he rambled for a little bit and then got into actually showing off the new Robo taxi that they're putting out the interesting thing about this Robo taxi it has no steering wheel it has no pedals you basically just get in it drives you to your destination and then you get out at the destination you can see as people use the car they're watching videos or doing work or having Zoom calls or watching sports showing that you're just like in this vehicle going to your destination and all of the time to the destination is now freed up time where you can do whatever you want they showed off all sorts of potential hazards that the robo taxis are equipped to stop for and recognize as they're driving stuff that if a human driver ran into this well the autonomous vehicles are probably going to actually handle them better like this dude going the wrong way in traffic or this guy just walking across a freeway here humans aren't going to handle this as well as these Robo taxis with cameras looking 360° around them will he also hammered in the point that so much of the world is covered in parking lots and he can see way less parking lots like green spaces and more space to be used for parks and things like that because now we don't need to park the cars the cars can drop you off and then go and take another driver somewhere or drive home and park in your garage after it drops you off making all of this parking lot space and all of these big cities available for other uses now he did give a little bit more details about the cars he said he expects these to be on the road by the end of 2026 he said before 2027 he also said he expects these Robo taxis to sell for about $30,000 anybody who can afford that $330,000 could own one of these Robo taxis and then they would have a fairly interesting business model on your hands because you can own one of these taxis for $30,000 it will take you wherever you need to go drop you off wherever you need to be and then if you want you'll be able to put it into a mode where it becomes like an Uber for you and it will go around and pick people up and drop them off and because you own the car you make make a large percentage of the money like he didn't actually break down how the monetization would work but people will buy these cars for roughly $30,000 use them when they need them and when they're not actually using them they'll have the option to put them into like a robo taxi mode where they can be driving around and picking up other people and dropping off other people while you earn money because your vehicle is out there doing that now he also showed off the fact that there isn't going to be a charging port on these either it's basically going to be like wireless charging for your phone where go and park this vehicle like over a powered parking spot it charges up the vehicle and then you can drive it away so no more plugging in and unplugging a charger he also then showed off what he called the Roven which is Robo van I don't know why he was saying it that way but he showed off his Robo van or Roven which is an autonomous bus essentially that can hold up to 20 people inside and uh take them around he was giving the example of using it to bring sports teams around or you know use it as like a party bus to go from like bar to bar or something like that and you can see it holds up to 20 people now inside it looked like it had about 8 9 10 11 12 13 like 14 or 15 seats but it also looked like another four or five people can stand while in the vehicle and it can drive people around no estimate yet on when this is coming he didn't talk about the range on any of these vehicles the only thing he did say was that the sort of Robo taxi Fleet will be be coming like next year but using the model x's and model y's that are already out on the roads and the model 3es and the Cyber trucks pretty much the Tesla Fleet of vehicles that are already out in the world they'll be able to be used as these Robo taxis I guess next year sometime and then the actual Robo taxi models that they showed at this event are supposedly going to be ready in 2026 he said before 2027 and when he was done showing off his Roven he brought in the Optimus robots to kind of show where they're at right now now he didn't really get into any like new details about these all he did say was that they're going to eventually cost less than a car all we really got to see them do during this event was a video of them watering plants playing like a board game washing a counter serving drinks helping get groceries out of the back of a car and of course something else we've seen quite a bit which is watching them dance cuz yeah they can they can do that as well they they they can dance overall it was a pretty cool event Elon kept calling it a party and it feels like they put on a giant party to unveil these Robo taxis and these Robo Vans and what the Optimus robots can do but it was also very short they didn't really go into too much detail around technical specs or anything like that we got a little bit of a tease of how much they'll cost we know the robo taxis will be about 30,000 we know that the Optimus robots will be less than than a car and we heard that the fully autonomous cars will be available sometime before 2027 obviously elon's always optimistic on his time frame so we'll see if that actually happens or not again I just love nerding out about this kind of stuff robots and autonomous vehicles and where all of this is headed in the future is just so fun and fascinating to me this was probably the biggest event of the week the the biggest like thing in the AI news World today's video is sponsored by LG and their incredible new LG gam Pro laptop picture this you're at a coffee shop pulling out your work machine everyone else is lugging around these bulky beefy laptops but not you because you got the LG gam Pro which is super light and also super slim toss this thing in a backpack and I promise you forget you're even carrying it but despite the fact that it's so light and thin it's actually a pretty powerful device it's got an Intel Core 7 Ultra processor and an Nvidia RTX graphic card in it but the real showstopper is the OLED display this is visual Perfection whether you're editing photos watching movies or YouTube videos or just Doom scrolling Twitter everything looks really good on this monitor but LG probably wouldn't have reached out to me if it didn't have some AI features as well the LG gram link app has an AI powered Gallery it's also got glance detection so it knows exactly when you're looking at it and can turn itself on when it knows you need to use it and that LG gram link app it's also a game changer for your workflow because it lets you seamlessly connect your smartphone and your laptop together to seamlessly transfer photos between the two and I'm not just talking about one device you can link up to 10 devices to this thing so if you're in the market for a laptop that's super light super powerful and has a bunch of cool AI built into it check out the LG gram Pro laptop your eyes will thank you your back will thank you and well ideally it should make you a heck of a lot more productive but that's still kind of on you saying that this laptop's going to do everything it can to help check out the link in the description to see LG's page all about this and I've also added some additional links to where you can find it directly on Amazon thank you so much to LG for sponsoring this video meta just showed off a new video generator that they've been working on called meta movie genen we can see some likely cherry-picked examples of what it's capable of here but they all look pretty good I mean they look on a similar level to the demos we've seen from Sora out there but this does seem to have a few cool features that we haven't really seen in the other video platforms yet so taking a look at the official page over on meta's website here again we can see some other examples notice that as this girl is running through the sand she's actually properly leaving Footprints this woman here looks really realistic but check this out there's actually a head shot here on the right so it was actually able to import somebody's real face and make a video of that person we can see here it says our latest research breakthroughs demonstrate how you can use Simple Text inputs to produce custom videos and sounds edit existing videos or transform your personal image into a unique video so this is an actual person being transferred into a video here's another example of Thunder cracks loudly with an orchestral music track that's the other thing it will actually create audio to go with these videos let's go ahead and unmute this here we can hear some background sound we can hear the th some background music all of that was created with this AI video generator Sora wasn't generating audio to go with the videos this actually is here's an example of it being edited we can see the text input here is transform the lantern into a bubble that Soares into the air and so the original video here has this Lantern floating into the air the edited video it changed that Lantern into a bubble so not only can you create video you can actually import your own face into them you can have it figure out audio sound effects and background music and you can even use it to like edit videos and change what's going on in the video similar to Sora meta showed this off and said look at this cool research we've done look at what we're able to do now but then didn't give anybody access so none of us have the option to go and play around with it yet but this looks like a pretty dang powerful and exciting new model that generates really really good videos but again also adds music sound effects Imports your own face and lets you edit some really really cool stuff with this meta movie gen I'll make sure it's linked up in the description so you can check it out yourself but that's not all we got in the world of AI video this company hello AI I have no idea how to pronounce that just launched an imageo video feature so what distinguishes this image to video experience well according to this tweet here tweet and image joint instruction following huo seamlessly integrates both text and image command inputs enhancing your visuals while precisely adhering to your prompts apparently it's much more accurate and can manipulate objects within your images and it's got a bunch of diverse Styles you can find this one over at hailo ai. videoo again don't know how to pronounce this one when you log into this site for the first time it does give you a 3-day free trial you can have up to three tasks in Q and you get bonus credits if you log in Daily but it looks like typically it's it's going to run you about $10 per month which gets you 1,000 credits per month and then you know you have that whole confusion of how many credits is something in a cost and not my favorite style of payment plan but you can try it for 3 days for free let's double check and see how long it actually takes to create a video I'll start with this image here that I use for a YouTube thumbnail and let's say an interactive map moves and glows behind a man wearing glasses and then I can turn this on to refin The Prompt let's go ahead and make sure the prompt is refined and let's see how long this takes and before we even get going here it says there are still 2,676 people ahead expect to wait for 15 minutes and here's the video that it generated so let's go ahead and click on this see if we can get a bigger screen of it this is actually pretty impressive we can see some animation going on in the background it looks like he's touching the screen you see another hand pop up the hand is just totally jacked up but it looks like a pretty decent looking little cartoon animation so it's using this Mini Max huo AI seems to be pretty good and again you get 3 days free to test it out and you can click around on the explore tab see some of the other videos that people have generated and honestly most of them look pretty dang impressive I think this one really holds up with a lot of the other ones and again you get a free 3-day trial so go mess around with it and see if it's for you that wasn't the only AI video news we got this week in fact there's a new generator in town called pyramid flow and it's open source this is the first AI video generator that we've seen of this caliber that's actually open source meaning that if you've got a strong enough computer you can download all of the code and run it locally without even being connected to the internet or you could run it on cloud servers they even have it available over on hugging face where you can generate it there and none of that information about what you're generating gets saved some of the people that were involved in making this generator are actually some of the same people that were behind the cling AI generator here's some of the examples they showed of what this is capable of here's some people you know walking in the snow under like cherry blossom trees here's a black and white video of a boat in front of a sort of weird looking Eiffel Tower some waves crashing against some Cliff sides that looks pretty solid and all of these videos are pretty decent looking they can generate up to 10 seconds and again it's open Source meaning that other developers and people that want to fine-tune these models are going to get their hands on it and things are going to start to get really really wild here as people start to make this open source model more and more capable and have different weights that they train it on so we can start to do different things the fact that we have a video generator that's open source but also this caliber of output is really really exciting quite honestly if you're a user of Zoom you're going to be able to let your AI Avatar talk for you pretty soon this is kind of crazy you'll soon be able to create a custom AI Avatar of yourself that you can use to record and send short messages to people it says Zoom is getting one step closer to letting AI avatars attend meetings for you zoom announced it will soon let you create an AI Avatar of yourself that you can use to send brief messages to your team you'll need to record an initial video of yourself and then zoom's AI will use that to make an avatar that looks and sounds like you so similar to what we've seen from hay aen in Synthesia and some of these other platforms and it doesn't look like your AI Avatar is going to be able to like sit in on the meeting for you yet like it's more designed to just use to send messages to people right now as you but they're implying here that eventually it's going to be a bunch of AI avatars on the meeting like that's going to be interesting can I just send my AI Avatar to jump on like Zoom team meetings the AI will just like fill me in later on what everything Wasing about what happens if everybody's an AI Avatar does anything actually get done in these meetings so many questions speaking of avatars hey Jen rolled out a new feature late last week called Avatar looks we can see in their demo video you can create multiple avatars and create multiple looks of the same character that you created in haen so here's another example of somebody here talking on screen and as I scroll through this video you can see it's the same person but different angles and different o looks of that Avatar and since we're on the topic of he Jen might as well mention this hen and HubSpot have actually partnered up if you make a blog post using your HubSpot account you can automatically have that blog post turned into an AI generated video of a talking Avatar explaining what's going on in that blog post we can see the title of this blog post hey Jen at HubSpot inbound the future of AI video and content generation and then this is the video that it automatically generated video is becoming the dominant medium for digital engagement and storytelling well there's a clip of the video that it created but you get the idea you make a blog post it automatically sends that blog post to haen you log into he genen and you now have a video version of somebody explaining what was going on in the blog post just a handy little workflow hack for people who like repurposing moving over to the world of AI image generation imen version 3 is now available to all Gemini users we head on over to Gemini over gemini.com here let's give it a prompt of generate an image of a snow Mountain close to the ocean we can see here it now says creating your image with image in three and here's my Snowy Mountain close to the ocean pretty good now Google had some problems with people's faces let's try generate a closeup image of a male Viking let's see if I can figure that out and right now it says I'm still learning how to generate certain kinds of images so I may not be able to create exactly what you're looking for yet also I can't help with photorealistic images of identifiable people apparently generating faces still doesn't work this is the free version of Gemini if I switch on over to the account where I actually have a Gemini Advanced account here let's see what happens generate a close up image of a male Viking and you can see inside of Gemini Advance the one I'm actually paying for it will actually generate faces now but it doesn't appear to want to generate faces if you're using the free version well we're on the topic of images I found this pretty cool from evolve in AI over on Instagram somebody figured out how to make these insanely realistic images like this girl in a coffee shop here this stream in front of some rocks the view out of like a van window or something a trail these images are all really realistic and something that you wouldn't immediately see and go that's obviously AI they just look like realistic images well the little hack was to use flux and for the prompt give them IMG 1018 CR to so basically just give it like Randomness and see what it generates so I like to use flux through the glyph app because right now you can actually use it inside of this app for free so I'll just quickly build a glyph here a text input an image generator and then for the image we'll just have it pull in whatever our text was here we'll just put prompt and then for our image generation model we're going to use flux Pro and I'm going to go 169 and we'll go ahead and close that now I can come over to my prompt here and just give it this prompt here IMG 108. crr2 run this glyph and theoretically it's going to make something random as hell but really realistic and there you go it's like a photo of a bunch of friends at a party or something like that but honestly pretty realistic I mean it's like really Pixy and grainy when I zoom in on it but from this shot here it just looks like a normal photo and of course we can change some of this around let's do like IMG 2489 he I see and let's run that glyph basically use the file name that would be saved directly out of the camera and look at that it's just a realistic macro shot of a flower so pretty cool little trick there something fun to try you can do it for free on glyph right now it's just kind of a crapshoot of what you're going to get but what you do get looks really realistic while we're on the topic of AI image generation Adobe is rolling out some new features to help prove that your art isn't AI slop Adobe announced on Tuesday that it will begin rolling out a b data of its content authenticity web app it will enable creators to digitally certify their works as human-made and is immediately launching a Content authenticity browser extension for Chrome to help protect content creators until the web app arrives this uses a combination of digital fingerprinting watermarking and cryptographic metadata to certify the authenticity of images video and audio files it's not going to use metadata where basically taking a picture of the picture removes all the information there's some sort of digital Watermark that will still help even if it was like a screenshotted image tell if it was AI generated or not all right I'm going to Rapid Fire a whole bunch of other AI news again it wasn't the craziest week we've ever seen but there's a handful of small things that I think are worth mentioning for example open AI is sort of getting frustrated with Microsoft right now they're saying that they're not moving fast enough to supply them with more and more servers open AI is trying to scale as fast as possible they partnered with Microsoft to be able to use their servers Microsoft isn't making those servers those gpus available at a fast enough Pace right now and I guess there's a little bit of tension between open Ai and Microsoft at least according to this article on the information since we're talking about open AI open AI made another content partnership they now partnered with Hurst Hurst includes Brands like the Houston Chronicle San Francisco Chronicle Esquire Cosmopolitan L Runners World Women's Health and others open AI is continuing that strategy of partnering with all the big content creators so that in the future when that content shows up inside of their responses they're not getting sued anymore this is also something I thought was pretty cool there's this new AI Tech inside of the Amazon driver vans that they're releasing that puts this little Green Dot on the package that the driver supposed to pull out and deliver so when the delivery van gets to somebody's house they jump in the back they look for the package with the Green Dot grab that one and go and deliver it and it uses AI to read all of the I guess barcodes on the boxes and pick the right one any box that's not the correct package we can see in this little screenshot they all have red x's on them and then there's the only this one with the Green Dot so it's very clear which one the driver is supposed to grab and take up to the door if you use the Opera browser They just added some new features they've got what they call the Arya Commander Bar so by pressing Control Plus or command plus you can type things like group all video tabs or bookmark all currently open tabs and Opera will do the desired command with all of the tabs that you currently have open I've never played with the Opera browser but stuff like this is making me want to I know a lot of people are big fans of the Ark browser I've played with that had a hard time migrating over kind of always end up back at Chrome but maybe I'll try Opera next in fact I'm curious in the comments let me know what browser do you use if you don't use Chrome I'm constantly trying to see if there's a browser that I like the workflow better but I always end up Landing back on Chrome so I'm curious what do you like if you use Gmail on your iOS device it's got an AI assistant now to help you manage your inbox you can log into Gmail and you'll get a little Gemini notification how can I help you today show unread emails from Today Show unread emails from this week get the status of my recent orders it will help you do all that stuff get some quick info just sort of at a glance Google's also been rolling out those features to help you write emails and summarize emails and things like that so over time email is eventually just going to become my AI talking your AI and no human's actually interacting I don't know that's where it feels like it's going at least there's a new feature coming to Android phones using Google's AI that will detect if your phone's been stolen and then lock whoever stole it out of your phone says the theft detection lock a unique security feature automatically locks your phone screen using artificial intelligence to prevent theft using Google AI the feature detects a typical motion link to theft arising out of someone grabbing your phone and trying to flee by bike car or other means your phone screen instantly locks if it detects the motion preventing thieves from having easy access to your data if you remember the rabbit devices the one that pretty much every Tech reviewer absolutely tore apart because it wasn't ready yet it didn't have that large action model built into it yet which was like the big selling point of the device in the first place well apparently they're starting to roll that out now I know Jesse Lou and rabbit have gotten a lot of crap for their device but they still seem to keep on shipping new features if feels like that Humane pin they put it out there got a lot of crap and then just sort of collapsed and they didn't seem to put anything new into it and everybody stopped talking about it at least rabbit still seems to be putting out new features pretty rapidly and it looks like we're finally getting this large action model that can sort of learn tasks and learn step-by-step processes and then follow through on those on your behalf I have a rabbit I haven't tested this new lamb yet but I will be testing it and sharing my thoughts after I've had a chance to test it out if you're in one of the countries that hasn't had access to meta AI while you're in luck 15 more countries now get access in the coming weeks to the new meta AI features including Brazil Bolivia Guatemala Paraguay Philippines and the UK it's also slated to roll out in Algeria Egypt Indonesia Iraq Jordan Libya Malaysia Morocco Saudi Arabia Sudan Thailand Tunisia United Arab Emirates Vietnam and Yemen over the coming weeks if you want to try meta Ai and you're one of those countries you're in luck a handful of big names in the AI world World recently won Nobel prizes Jeffrey Hinton often referred to as the Godfather of AI along with John hopfield both won Nobel prizes in physics for their work in foundational AI Hinton who has a PHD in artificial intelligence went on to co-create the back propagation algorithm a method that allows neural networks to learn from their mistakes transforming how AI models are trained his company was acquired by Google he worked for Google for several years before quitting because he wanted to spread the word about the dangers of AI now John hopfield is a professor at Princeton he was also one of the early Pioneers in AI developing the hopfield network a type of neural network that transformed AI by demonstrating how neural networks can store and retrieve patterns but they weren't the only AI people to get Nobel prizes in fact we have Demis hbus and John jumper who are awarded Nobel prizes in chemistry Demis is the CEO of Google Deep Mind and John jumper is the director at Deep Mind and they won this no prize for their work on Alpha fold which is a groundbreaking AI system that predicts the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acids which has just helped lead to a whole bunch of new discoveries and finally I found this interesting enough to include it an electronic tongue reveals ai's inner thoughts this is out of Penn State here they developed a electronic tongue that's capable of identifying differences in similar liquids such as milk with varying water content diverse products including soda types and coffee Blends signs of spoilage and fruit juices and instances of food safety concerns the electronic tongue can be useful for food safety and production as well as for medical Diagnostics the sensor and its AI can broadly detect and classify various substances while collectively assessing their respective quality authenticity and freshness basically we're getting a AI tongue that can taste things and let us know if it's spoil or rotten or will'll make sick or various things like that and I just found that really really fascinating because it could potentially help prevent a lot of issues from food and liquids and things like that and that's what I got for you today again not the craziest week in AI news at least not compared to most weeks over the last couple years but still some really interesting stuff some really fun stuff that we can do with videos and image generation lately a lot of fun toys for us AI nerds to go play with if you like video like this you want to see more AI tools more AI tutorials and stay looped in and keep your finger on the pulse of

    Here's the transcript of the video: [compared to other weeks it's been a relatively slow week in the world of AI however we got some really cool stuff out of Tesla and their we robot event that happened and there was also a ton of advancements in the world of AI video so let's just Dive Right In starting with the Tesla wi robot event where Elon showed off some of the things they've been working on over at Tesla now the event started off with Elon getting into an autonomous vehicle and driving around the lot here there is nobody driving the car that's just Elon riding in the front seat as it drives him over to I guess the stage where he's presenting on they have this moment where he drives around the corner and as he drives around the corner some bicycles right out in front of them and the car knows to stop to show that it's actually aware of all the stuff that's happening he rambled for a little bit and then got into actually showing off the new Robo taxi that they're putting out the interesting thing about this Robo taxi it has no steering wheel it has no pedals you basically just get in it drives you to your destination and then you get out at the destination you can see as people use the car they're watching videos or doing work or having Zoom calls or watching sports showing that you're just like in this vehicle going to your destination and all of the time to the destination is now freed up time where you can do whatever you want they showed off all sorts of potential hazards that the robo taxis are equipped to stop for and recognize as they're driving stuff that if a human driver ran into this well the autonomous vehicles are probably going to actually handle them better like this dude going the wrong way in traffic or this guy just walking across a freeway here humans aren't going to handle this as well as these Robo taxis with cameras looking 360° around them will he also hammered in the point that so much of the world is covered in parking lots and he can see way less parking lots like green spaces and more space to be used for parks and things like that because now we don't need to park the cars the cars can drop you off and then go and take another driver somewhere or drive home and park in your garage after it drops you off making all of this parking lot space and all of these big cities available for other uses now he did give a little bit more details about the cars he said he expects these to be on the road by the end of 2026 he said before 2027 he also said he expects these Robo taxis to sell for about $30,000 anybody who can afford that $330,000 could own one of these Robo taxis and then they would have a fairly interesting business model on your hands because you can own one of these taxis for $30,000 it will take you wherever you need to go drop you off wherever you need to be and then if you want you'll be able to put it into a mode where it becomes like an Uber for you and it will go around and pick people up and drop them off and because you own the car you make make a large percentage of the money like he didn't actually break down how the monetization would work but people will buy these cars for roughly $30,000 use them when they need them and when they're not actually using them they'll have the option to put them into like a robo taxi mode where they can be driving around and picking up other people and dropping off other people while you earn money because your vehicle is out there doing that now he also showed off the fact that there isn't going to be a charging port on these either it's basically going to be like wireless charging for your phone where go and park this vehicle like over a powered parking spot it charges up the vehicle and then you can drive it away so no more plugging in and unplugging a charger he also then showed off what he called the Roven which is Robo van I don't know why he was saying it that way but he showed off his Robo van or Roven which is an autonomous bus essentially that can hold up to 20 people inside and uh take them around he was giving the example of using it to bring sports teams around or you know use it as like a party bus to go from like bar to bar or something like that and you can see it holds up to 20 people now inside it looked like it had about 8 9 10 11 12 13 like 14 or 15 seats but it also looked like another four or five people can stand while in the vehicle and it can drive people around no estimate yet on when this is coming he didn't talk about the range on any of these vehicles the only thing he did say was that the sort of Robo taxi Fleet will be be coming like next year but using the model x's and model y's that are already out on the roads and the model 3es and the Cyber trucks pretty much the Tesla Fleet of vehicles that are already out in the world they'll be able to be used as these Robo taxis I guess next year sometime and then the actual Robo taxi models that they showed at this event are supposedly going to be ready in 2026 he said before 2027 and when he was done showing off his Roven he brought in the Optimus robots to kind of show where they're at right now now he didn't really get into any like new details about these all he did say was that they're going to eventually cost less than a car all we really got to see them do during this event was a video of them watering plants playing like a board game washing a counter serving drinks helping get groceries out of the back of a car and of course something else we've seen quite a bit which is watching them dance cuz yeah they can they can do that as well they they they can dance overall it was a pretty cool event Elon kept calling it a party and it feels like they put on a giant party to unveil these Robo taxis and these Robo Vans and what the Optimus robots can do but it was also very short they didn't really go into too much detail around technical specs or anything like that we got a little bit of a tease of how much they'll cost we know the robo taxis will be about 30,000 we know that the Optimus robots will be less than than a car and we heard that the fully autonomous cars will be available sometime before 2027 obviously elon's always optimistic on his time frame so we'll see if that actually happens or not again I just love nerding out about this kind of stuff robots and autonomous vehicles and where all of this is headed in the future is just so fun and fascinating to me this was probably the biggest event of the week the the biggest like thing in the AI news World today's video is sponsored by LG and their incredible new LG gam Pro laptop picture this you're at a coffee shop pulling out your work machine everyone else is lugging around these bulky beefy laptops but not you because you got the LG gam Pro which is super light and also super slim toss this thing in a backpack and I promise you forget you're even carrying it but despite the fact that it's so light and thin it's actually a pretty powerful device it's got an Intel Core 7 Ultra processor and an Nvidia RTX graphic card in it but the real showstopper is the OLED display this is visual Perfection whether you're editing photos watching movies or YouTube videos or just Doom scrolling Twitter everything looks really good on this monitor but LG probably wouldn't have reached out to me if it didn't have some AI features as well the LG gram link app has an AI powered Gallery it's also got glance detection so it knows exactly when you're looking at it and can turn itself on when it knows you need to use it and that LG gram link app it's also a game changer for your workflow because it lets you seamlessly connect your smartphone and your laptop together to seamlessly transfer photos between the two and I'm not just talking about one device you can link up to 10 devices to this thing so if you're in the market for a laptop that's super light super powerful and has a bunch of cool AI built into it check out the LG gram Pro laptop your eyes will thank you your back will thank you and well ideally it should make you a heck of a lot more productive but that's still kind of on you saying that this laptop's going to do everything it can to help check out the link in the description to see LG's page all about this and I've also added some additional links to where you can find it directly on Amazon thank you so much to LG for sponsoring this video meta just showed off a new video generator that they've been working on called meta movie genen we can see some likely cherry-picked examples of what it's capable of here but they all look pretty good I mean they look on a similar level to the demos we've seen from Sora out there but this does seem to have a few cool features that we haven't really seen in the other video platforms yet so taking a look at the official page over on meta's website here again we can see some other examples notice that as this girl is running through the sand she's actually properly leaving Footprints this woman here looks really realistic but check this out there's actually a head shot here on the right so it was actually able to import somebody's real face and make a video of that person we can see here it says our latest research breakthroughs demonstrate how you can use Simple Text inputs to produce custom videos and sounds edit existing videos or transform your personal image into a unique video so this is an actual person being transferred into a video here's another example of Thunder cracks loudly with an orchestral music track that's the other thing it will actually create audio to go with these videos let's go ahead and unmute this here we can hear some background sound we can hear the th some background music all of that was created with this AI video generator Sora wasn't generating audio to go with the videos this actually is here's an example of it being edited we can see the text input here is transform the lantern into a bubble that Soares into the air and so the original video here has this Lantern floating into the air the edited video it changed that Lantern into a bubble so not only can you create video you can actually import your own face into them you can have it figure out audio sound effects and background music and you can even use it to like edit videos and change what's going on in the video similar to Sora meta showed this off and said look at this cool research we've done look at what we're able to do now but then didn't give anybody access so none of us have the option to go and play around with it yet but this looks like a pretty dang powerful and exciting new model that generates really really good videos but again also adds music sound effects Imports your own face and lets you edit some really really cool stuff with this meta movie gen I'll make sure it's linked up in the description so you can check it out yourself but that's not all we got in the world of AI video this company hello AI I have no idea how to pronounce that just launched an imageo video feature so what distinguishes this image to video experience well according to this tweet here tweet and image joint instruction following huo seamlessly integrates both text and image command inputs enhancing your visuals while precisely adhering to your prompts apparently it's much more accurate and can manipulate objects within your images and it's got a bunch of diverse Styles you can find this one over at hailo ai. videoo again don't know how to pronounce this one when you log into this site for the first time it does give you a 3-day free trial you can have up to three tasks in Q and you get bonus credits if you log in Daily but it looks like typically it's it's going to run you about $10 per month which gets you 1,000 credits per month and then you know you have that whole confusion of how many credits is something in a cost and not my favorite style of payment plan but you can try it for 3 days for free let's double check and see how long it actually takes to create a video I'll start with this image here that I use for a YouTube thumbnail and let's say an interactive map moves and glows behind a man wearing glasses and then I can turn this on to refin The Prompt let's go ahead and make sure the prompt is refined and let's see how long this takes and before we even get going here it says there are still 2,676 people ahead expect to wait for 15 minutes and here's the video that it generated so let's go ahead and click on this see if we can get a bigger screen of it this is actually pretty impressive we can see some animation going on in the background it looks like he's touching the screen you see another hand pop up the hand is just totally jacked up but it looks like a pretty decent looking little cartoon animation so it's using this Mini Max huo AI seems to be pretty good and again you get 3 days free to test it out and you can click around on the explore tab see some of the other videos that people have generated and honestly most of them look pretty dang impressive I think this one really holds up with a lot of the other ones and again you get a free 3-day trial so go mess around with it and see if it's for you that wasn't the only AI video news we got this week in fact there's a new generator in town called pyramid flow and it's open source this is the first AI video generator that we've seen of this caliber that's actually open source meaning that if you've got a strong enough computer you can download all of the code and run it locally without even being connected to the internet or you could run it on cloud servers they even have it available over on hugging face where you can generate it there and none of that information about what you're generating gets saved some of the people that were involved in making this generator are actually some of the same people that were behind the cling AI generator here's some of the examples they showed of what this is capable of here's some people you know walking in the snow under like cherry blossom trees here's a black and white video of a boat in front of a sort of weird looking Eiffel Tower some waves crashing against some Cliff sides that looks pretty solid and all of these videos are pretty decent looking they can generate up to 10 seconds and again it's open Source meaning that other developers and people that want to fine-tune these models are going to get their hands on it and things are going to start to get really really wild here as people start to make this open source model more and more capable and have different weights that they train it on so we can start to do different things the fact that we have a video generator that's open source but also this caliber of output is really really exciting quite honestly if you're a user of Zoom you're going to be able to let your AI Avatar talk for you pretty soon this is kind of crazy you'll soon be able to create a custom AI Avatar of yourself that you can use to record and send short messages to people it says Zoom is getting one step closer to letting AI avatars attend meetings for you zoom announced it will soon let you create an AI Avatar of yourself that you can use to send brief messages to your team you'll need to record an initial video of yourself and then zoom's AI will use that to make an avatar that looks and sounds like you so similar to what we've seen from hay aen in Synthesia and some of these other platforms and it doesn't look like your AI Avatar is going to be able to like sit in on the meeting for you yet like it's more designed to just use to send messages to people right now as you but they're implying here that eventually it's going to be a bunch of AI avatars on the meeting like that's going to be interesting can I just send my AI Avatar to jump on like Zoom team meetings the AI will just like fill me in later on what everything Wasing about what happens if everybody's an AI Avatar does anything actually get done in these meetings so many questions speaking of avatars hey Jen rolled out a new feature late last week called Avatar looks we can see in their demo video you can create multiple avatars and create multiple looks of the same character that you created in haen so here's another example of somebody here talking on screen and as I scroll through this video you can see it's the same person but different angles and different o looks of that Avatar and since we're on the topic of he Jen might as well mention this hen and HubSpot have actually partnered up if you make a blog post using your HubSpot account you can automatically have that blog post turned into an AI generated video of a talking Avatar explaining what's going on in that blog post we can see the title of this blog post hey Jen at HubSpot inbound the future of AI video and content generation and then this is the video that it automatically generated video is becoming the dominant medium for digital engagement and storytelling well there's a clip of the video that it created but you get the idea you make a blog post it automatically sends that blog post to haen you log into he genen and you now have a video version of somebody explaining what was going on in the blog post just a handy little workflow hack for people who like repurposing moving over to the world of AI image generation imen version 3 is now available to all Gemini users we head on over to Gemini over gemini.com here let's give it a prompt of generate an image of a snow Mountain close to the ocean we can see here it now says creating your image with image in three and here's my Snowy Mountain close to the ocean pretty good now Google had some problems with people's faces let's try generate a closeup image of a male Viking let's see if I can figure that out and right now it says I'm still learning how to generate certain kinds of images so I may not be able to create exactly what you're looking for yet also I can't help with photorealistic images of identifiable people apparently generating faces still doesn't work this is the free version of Gemini if I switch on over to the account where I actually have a Gemini Advanced account here let's see what happens generate a close up image of a male Viking and you can see inside of Gemini Advance the one I'm actually paying for it will actually generate faces now but it doesn't appear to want to generate faces if you're using the free version well we're on the topic of images I found this pretty cool from evolve in AI over on Instagram somebody figured out how to make these insanely realistic images like this girl in a coffee shop here this stream in front of some rocks the view out of like a van window or something a trail these images are all really realistic and something that you wouldn't immediately see and go that's obviously AI they just look like realistic images well the little hack was to use flux and for the prompt give them IMG 1018 CR to so basically just give it like Randomness and see what it generates so I like to use flux through the glyph app because right now you can actually use it inside of this app for free so I'll just quickly build a glyph here a text input an image generator and then for the image we'll just have it pull in whatever our text was here we'll just put prompt and then for our image generation model we're going to use flux Pro and I'm going to go 169 and we'll go ahead and close that now I can come over to my prompt here and just give it this prompt here IMG 108. crr2 run this glyph and theoretically it's going to make something random as hell but really realistic and there you go it's like a photo of a bunch of friends at a party or something like that but honestly pretty realistic I mean it's like really Pixy and grainy when I zoom in on it but from this shot here it just looks like a normal photo and of course we can change some of this around let's do like IMG 2489 he I see and let's run that glyph basically use the file name that would be saved directly out of the camera and look at that it's just a realistic macro shot of a flower so pretty cool little trick there something fun to try you can do it for free on glyph right now it's just kind of a crapshoot of what you're going to get but what you do get looks really realistic while we're on the topic of AI image generation Adobe is rolling out some new features to help prove that your art isn't AI slop Adobe announced on Tuesday that it will begin rolling out a b data of its content authenticity web app it will enable creators to digitally certify their works as human-made and is immediately launching a Content authenticity browser extension for Chrome to help protect content creators until the web app arrives this uses a combination of digital fingerprinting watermarking and cryptographic metadata to certify the authenticity of images video and audio files it's not going to use metadata where basically taking a picture of the picture removes all the information there's some sort of digital Watermark that will still help even if it was like a screenshotted image tell if it was AI generated or not all right I'm going to Rapid Fire a whole bunch of other AI news again it wasn't the craziest week we've ever seen but there's a handful of small things that I think are worth mentioning for example open AI is sort of getting frustrated with Microsoft right now they're saying that they're not moving fast enough to supply them with more and more servers open AI is trying to scale as fast as possible they partnered with Microsoft to be able to use their servers Microsoft isn't making those servers those gpus available at a fast enough Pace right now and I guess there's a little bit of tension between open Ai and Microsoft at least according to this article on the information since we're talking about open AI open AI made another content partnership they now partnered with Hurst Hurst includes Brands like the Houston Chronicle San Francisco Chronicle Esquire Cosmopolitan L Runners World Women's Health and others open AI is continuing that strategy of partnering with all the big content creators so that in the future when that content shows up inside of their responses they're not getting sued anymore this is also something I thought was pretty cool there's this new AI Tech inside of the Amazon driver vans that they're releasing that puts this little Green Dot on the package that the driver supposed to pull out and deliver so when the delivery van gets to somebody's house they jump in the back they look for the package with the Green Dot grab that one and go and deliver it and it uses AI to read all of the I guess barcodes on the boxes and pick the right one any box that's not the correct package we can see in this little screenshot they all have red x's on them and then there's the only this one with the Green Dot so it's very clear which one the driver is supposed to grab and take up to the door if you use the Opera browser They just added some new features they've got what they call the Arya Commander Bar so by pressing Control Plus or command plus you can type things like group all video tabs or bookmark all currently open tabs and Opera will do the desired command with all of the tabs that you currently have open I've never played with the Opera browser but stuff like this is making me want to I know a lot of people are big fans of the Ark browser I've played with that had a hard time migrating over kind of always end up back at Chrome but maybe I'll try Opera next in fact I'm curious in the comments let me know what browser do you use if you don't use Chrome I'm constantly trying to see if there's a browser that I like the workflow better but I always end up Landing back on Chrome so I'm curious what do you like if you use Gmail on your iOS device it's got an AI assistant now to help you manage your inbox you can log into Gmail and you'll get a little Gemini notification how can I help you today show unread emails from Today Show unread emails from this week get the status of my recent orders it will help you do all that stuff get some quick info just sort of at a glance Google's also been rolling out those features to help you write emails and summarize emails and things like that so over time email is eventually just going to become my AI talking your AI and no human's actually interacting I don't know that's where it feels like it's going at least there's a new feature coming to Android phones using Google's AI that will detect if your phone's been stolen and then lock whoever stole it out of your phone says the theft detection lock a unique security feature automatically locks your phone screen using artificial intelligence to prevent theft using Google AI the feature detects a typical motion link to theft arising out of someone grabbing your phone and trying to flee by bike car or other means your phone screen instantly locks if it detects the motion preventing thieves from having easy access to your data if you remember the rabbit devices the one that pretty much every Tech reviewer absolutely tore apart because it wasn't ready yet it didn't have that large action model built into it yet which was like the big selling point of the device in the first place well apparently they're starting to roll that out now I know Jesse Lou and rabbit have gotten a lot of crap for their device but they still seem to keep on shipping new features if feels like that Humane pin they put it out there got a lot of crap and then just sort of collapsed and they didn't seem to put anything new into it and everybody stopped talking about it at least rabbit still seems to be putting out new features pretty rapidly and it looks like we're finally getting this large action model that can sort of learn tasks and learn step-by-step processes and then follow through on those on your behalf I have a rabbit I haven't tested this new lamb yet but I will be testing it and sharing my thoughts after I've had a chance to test it out if you're in one of the countries that hasn't had access to meta AI while you're in luck 15 more countries now get access in the coming weeks to the new meta AI features including Brazil Bolivia Guatemala Paraguay Philippines and the UK it's also slated to roll out in Algeria Egypt Indonesia Iraq Jordan Libya Malaysia Morocco Saudi Arabia Sudan Thailand Tunisia United Arab Emirates Vietnam and Yemen over the coming weeks if you want to try meta Ai and you're one of those countries you're in luck a handful of big names in the AI world World recently won Nobel prizes Jeffrey Hinton often referred to as the Godfather of AI along with John hopfield both won Nobel prizes in physics for their work in foundational AI Hinton who has a PHD in artificial intelligence went on to co-create the back propagation algorithm a method that allows neural networks to learn from their mistakes transforming how AI models are trained his company was acquired by Google he worked for Google for several years before quitting because he wanted to spread the word about the dangers of AI now John hopfield is a professor at Princeton he was also one of the early Pioneers in AI developing the hopfield network a type of neural network that transformed AI by demonstrating how neural networks can store and retrieve patterns but they weren't the only AI people to get Nobel prizes in fact we have Demis hbus and John jumper who are awarded Nobel prizes in chemistry Demis is the CEO of Google Deep Mind and John jumper is the director at Deep Mind and they won this no prize for their work on Alpha fold which is a groundbreaking AI system that predicts the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acids which has just helped lead to a whole bunch of new discoveries and finally I found this interesting enough to include it an electronic tongue reveals ai's inner thoughts this is out of Penn State here they developed a electronic tongue that's capable of identifying differences in similar liquids such as milk with varying water content diverse products including soda types and coffee Blends signs of spoilage and fruit juices and instances of food safety concerns the electronic tongue can be useful for food safety and production as well as for medical Diagnostics the sensor and its AI can broadly detect and classify various substances while collectively assessing their respective quality authenticity and freshness basically we're getting a AI tongue that can taste things and let us know if it's spoil or rotten or will'll make sick or various things like that and I just found that really really fascinating because it could potentially help prevent a lot of issues from food and liquids and things like that and that's what I got for you today again not the craziest week in AI news at least not compared to most weeks over the last couple years but still some really interesting stuff some really fun stuff that we can do with videos and image generation lately a lot of fun toys for us AI nerds to go play with if you like video like this you want to see more AI tools more AI tutorials and stay looped in and keep your finger on the pulse of
