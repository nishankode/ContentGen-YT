1 hour ago,Q_aJU-lHwgQ,WHAT DOES AN INTERIOR DESIGNER DO ? SARAH SHAM OF ESSAJEES ATELIER ON THE DUBAI REAL ESTATE PODCAST,tahirmajithia,"hey guys welcome to a brand new episode of the Dubai real estate podcast I'm your host tah maiia today I'm really excited for this episode because joining with me on the show is SAR sham the founder of asa's atellier from Bombay who' just set up a new Venture in Dubai they've just opened up their shop in Dubai and I'm really excited because she's one of the top leading interior designers of India who's coming to Dubai and I've been following her work for a very long time I really love what they've been doing and so for that reason I thought why not have on the show to discuss what's going on you know what are the interior design Trends going on how can someone really enhance their spaces etc etc guys before I start the show if you're watching this on YouTube please do subscribe to my YouTube channel hit the notification Bell to stay updated your share likes and comments are really appreciated Spotify listeners please do follow and apple podcast listeners please do give us a five star rating and review and now let's skew the music [Music] hi Sarah thank you so much for taking uh time out from a busy schedule and joining us on the podcast why don't you start with a quick introduction on what do you do and a little more about yourself thank you so much for having me tah my name is Sarah I run an interior design studio called Isa aelia uh we've been around for about it's a fourth generation brand called Isa 30 Years of Legacy uh we have been around as an independent Design Studio doing the most luxury interior design spaces for about 10 years now in India and recently branched out to having our own office in Dubai under a bana called Gia oh wow that's great that's great so what uh got you to Dubai why Dubai I think that the Dubai Market is in desperate need of the off the services that we're offering and uh the way we do things is very very different and I can see that it's a booming market and there's a lot of demand here and so I want a piece of that pie that's great that's great so you know you just mentioned right now the things which are being different yeah so what do you what is it that you guys do differently as compared to say anyone else uh over here so I think the first offering is that it's super super customized okay we have absolutely the best sourcing in India and so whether it is curtains fabric upholstery embroidery hand knotted rugs uh completely custom crafted Furniture we can literally put everything into container and bring it to Dubai Dubai as we know doesn't manufacture a lot as U they import a lot of stuff and India being a country that has massive manufacturing capacity I feel like uh the kind of customization that we bring into our projects it is just not done here not to the extent that we do it we customize every thread every light every piece of everything you know every ergonomic height of everything is customized and also the process for us is very different we start from be shell and we do not leave till the glass toothbrush and toothpaste and bathroom hook and toilet paper holders placed on site so in Dubai I'm feeling like it's a very fragmented way of working where there's like you know you can get these design proposals then you're supposed to go shopping around to a contractor and get it made yourself um that endtoend service is not there in the way that we offer it and we also have a lot of project management that's built into what we already offer um so yeah I think it's a very very different offering okay and when you talk about you know uh the services you'll offer so is it only interior design or what are the services exactly uh your company would offer so it's uh conceptualization um all of the working drawings material selections definitely the interior designing part of it and then as well as the entire execution piece of it in terms of project management so we'll budget track we'll find the right contractors we'll find you the best vendors and makers and collaborators and artists to work with on the project and uh we'll be there with you from start to finish so it's literally an endtoend handholding service yeah now you know you Al right you said you know you do a lot of manufacturing everything obviously India is one of you know uh the biggest manufacturing hubs uh around the world uh how much of a difference does it make uh cost-wise if someone was to buy something here or get the same thing done over here yeah I know that obviously you know there's certain things which when you manufacture in India forget whether you get it done here but the quality is far better yeah okay uh but apart that how much of a difference does it put in cost um so this is we're not doing it for theost cost we're doing it for the quality but I will answer your question and say it's way cheaper so if we're looking at a hand knotted rug uh when we had we've actually completed an 18,000 foot J Islands Mansion already and uh when we were doing that and we went to the stores shopping around for rugs the quality of rugs and the kns per square inch that were there in the rugs compared to what we can do in India for a completely customized hand kned rug uh after shipping it and with the you know import duties and the rest of all of it and putting it all on container it was at half the price so and my client got literally exactly the right size shape design we've selected every every last thread and the same applies for curtains for some reason curtains here are very very expensive and uh you know I mean not for some reason we we know what the reasons are is because in India we manufacture everything so strangely enough it was cheaper for me to fly down my best curtain consultant from Dubai uh from India to Dubai measure the entire space hand embroider and custom make all the curtains in the highest quality of linen silk satin with the best thread workor and then come here and fly two of her installers and install it still at a significantly Less Price Right and much better quality way better quality and the other thing that I noticed in Dubai is that there are like a lot of cookie Cara houses you know so you have these large developments where the builders and the developers have made all the homes look the same and then in these developments there are designers who are doing 20 Villas that again all look similar you know so we we don't do that in India at all that's not the model in which we work with so for example we're doing seven apartments in one building um it's like a very very highend building like 50 million Dirhams an apartment okay however between the two apartments you would not even be able to guess that the same designer is doing it because everything is so different you know so we don't have any standards set of everything so that's the part that I find surprising about this Market is that people actually have the money but why would you want a cookie Cara house when you can actually you know get something that's so much more above and beyond and U we've presented to a bunch of people this is my first time presenting for my Dubai brand with my new partnership with Abra and U the response has been phenomenal people are like absolutely no one is doing this here so we're very positive and feel like um yeah we're going to do well in this market no no that's that's great no what you said is absolutely right there's you know there are a lot of people a lot of uh things but uh you know everyone is looking at cutting Corners just finishing the job and as you said you know uh even multi-million dollar homes sometimes you go into a community and they all look the same yeah in India uh definitely especially you know City like Bombay uh if two houses look the same nobody's going to buy it absolutely not even if they're the same family they still want it uh you know so that that's the part that's like I really wonder like you're spending 50 million 80 million on buying the house but you're okay with it looking like everything else in the community like how does that make sense or you're okay shopping from all the same stores all the same Brands as everyone else after you spent all that money why you know you there's so many better and more different options that are available out there and uh that's what we're hoping to bring all right now so tell me more about you know uh you you've built this company over the past uh decade and uh you know you're the principal architect how has your journey been like if if someone today because there are a lot of people who want to get into uh this field of interior design architecture right uh how's your journey been um it's been a journey uh lots and lots and lots of ups and downs so initially when I started out while we do have the family Legacy and Company I was very clear that I wanted to do this on my own so I didn't use any of my dad's contacts or any of the family Connections in order to get my first few clients um I did work with him for 5 years and then he would tell me like listen you know XYZ person is making this house and this space and why don't you but I was like no I'm going to find my own clients so initial years were very hard tah um I used to do only single bathroom projects single bedroom projects um I got shouted at a lot it's not a glamorous job uh most days are standing on site getting shouted at by clients so I really like clawed my way to where I am at right now and so I don't take anything lightly I don't take anything for granted um and yeah I feel like my Journey's Just Begun I have a long way to go and I'm looking forward to everything to come but if you if you look back 10 years right what were the key things uh you would say you did right and what would probably if you could change if you go if you could go back and change some things what would that be so I actually had 12 jobs before I was an interior designer yeah so I used to be a news Anor at Bloomberg which is why a setup like this seems very familiar for me um I used to work as an art consultant I have worked at a hedge fund I've worked at all kinds of jobs I worked at um saffronart I worked at uh Vogue um I was an intern there when they were launching the magazine I worked um at GRE Global the advertising agency so essentially I tried out a lot of jobs and I sucked at all of them I was really really bad and then I went back to working with my dad during which time a client told me uh listen you have a very good eye why don't you try interior design and I had already failed so many times that I felt like okay what's the worst that can happen but when I tried interior design irrespective of all the hardships I literally felt like you know like the Angels were singing the Red Sea had parted everything had aligned for me like literally everything had aligned because I was like wow I love it and I'm so good at it so I think uh what really worked in the Plus for me um what I would always do again and again is try everything and keep at it because I feel like I learned not just what I like but what I don't like so then when that thing it's like you know kissing many frogs to find your prince I did exactly that um for my career and if I had to look back and say the one thing that I would not have done again is that I think I said yes to everything you know I would have just said no a lot more so I was so desperate for work that I used to say yes to every project every client even if I felt like it wasn't a match for me and that ended up in either unhappy clients or I was unhappy or projects that didn't turn out the way I wanted to and I feel like I was always better off with less clients and less projects but the good ones good ones true so now I'm at that point where I'm like listen I will wait I will look around I'll find the right person the right project the right clientele for me I'm not in a hurry to have some certain number of XY Z I'm better focused on the quality people who respect me people who speak nicely to me people who respect us creatively and who are nice to deal with and work with yeah that's great that's great to know now tell me something you know uh when it is say something a a job like yours where uh it's every project has to be different or you know this thing how does this creativity actually come out like is it is there somewhere you take inspiration from or is it uh like you know different concepts in the mind my team so we start with the clients um we're very client Centric so uh we actually don't think we have a set signature style if you are the client we'd be like listen what's your style what do you like and then you'll tell us okay I like I don't know like beige with a touch of gold okay and then within that then we'll explore an as a team brainstorm concept and genuinely blessed with a very very creative team and so because we allow creative freedom to everyone in our studio that's how the outcomes are so different because everyone is kind of you know chipping in their two cents and uh that's how each project turns out how it does it's truly collaborative yeah that's great now when it comes to uh you know uh like you said previously you know when you see homes in Dubai what are the trends you feel that uh are not or the type of material you don't get to see here uh which probably you would probably want to do so what I do see a lot is like these very neutral spaces and beiges you know I see a lot of them with like an aak W and neutral tones and that's actually a beautiful aesthetic I don't think there's anything wrong with that aesthetic but I just feel like I wish people played with color a bit more that did spaces that were more colorful and I feel like in this attempt for everyone to like look cool and fit in they losing their own individuality right and so I would love to see spaces that are like weird funky conceptual and um I I feel like there are a lot of homes that all look derivative and similar yeah okay now uh also uh you know when you see nowadays especially when uh you see developer homes being handed over and especially apartments or even Villas town houses as cost or prices are going up most Developers or you know are going small in sizes right as a designer what would you advise if there's a small space okay and someone wants to still you know make sure there's complete what what what are your tips on doing up a place which is small so we've all I'm from Bombay uh my one of my early projects was like a 700 Square fo two bedroomroom Hall and kitchen for a family of three with four cats so I think no is too small for me I'm totally open-minded and for all of us in Bombay like a 2,000t apartment it's considered a palace okay so here what you guys consider small is relatively very reasonably sized for a Bombay person but having said that I think what we've realized um from living in smaller spaces is multi-use Furniture is the name of the game you have to have you know a dressing table that doubles up as a desk um a dining table that can fold out when there's more guest a sof that has hidden storage underneath um you know a partition that can close off and a separate room is created things like that that allow you to use the space in multiple ways and not you're not just stuck using it as is and the other thing is like guest rooms the one thing we tell our clients is that a lot of people live for parties and guest rooms okay so they said when we have a party where will people sit and then we ask our clients how often do you have a party in your house and they' be like at least once a month month I'm like cool okay so there's 12 months in the year so even if I say 15 days so of 365 days You're Building something that for 350 days of the year is not going to make sense to you so don't oh like the guest every year my sister comes and stays with me for 2 weeks okay now I I love that I'm very close to my family but don't build your whole home for those for those you know build it for your everyday functionality and for the odd occurrence is you know have a backup have a solution of course but don't compromise every day right for once in a while got it yeah when you look at a space okay what's the first thing you think about light okay ceiling height um energy that's great that's great and what are the trends you're seeing now going ahead what do you think the next you know uh four five years what kind of Trends will we see more when it comes to interior designs I feel like because Dubai is such an international place I think people of so many nationalities are coming in and trying all kinds of they're openminded to new and different things and I definitely see it with the commercial design with the restaurant design it's unbelievable I mean some of the restaurants some of the retail stores are so good and some of the designers doing them are unreal I mean way way ahead and doing some superb things so I feel like I'm going to see I'm hoping to see that happen in the residential space as well by the way we do Residential plan commercial spaces we don't only do Residential when it comes to uh Dubai what was what's your uh main focus going to be as a company client is happy that's the main focus that's our main focus in all across life is maintain the relationship with the client client should be happy all else takes uh back seat so it's super client focused very good and you know uh as you mentioned that when you meet a client the client's brief or you know is there but at the same time you know uh from someone coming from a creative background how do you face the challenges when sometimes you want to do something creatively but the client is not really aligned or is not able to Envision that because I mean from a real estate aspect I see this a lot of times that there are a lot of people no matter how many flow plans you explain them or whatever but they want to see the space okay they can't really Envision or or imagine how that place is going to be so how do you deal with challenges like that because I'm sure you must be facing this so I actually feel really bad because I know that they're genuinely wanting to understand how the space looks but they're just not able to and it's very frustrating for them as well because they're like but I can't understand you know so in scenarios like that we usually have an early conversation where we're like are you good at visualizing spaces are you not and if they say we really struggle with visualizing we try and give them as many tools as as possible obviously 3D views physical samples but also tell them at an early stage that you have to let go a little bit and there has to be a large element of trust with us as your designers that I may not be able to 100% understand how this is going to look but I trust that my designer will get me you know to that end point and that this is going to make sense so um I think just letting go a little bit goes a long way okay and uh you know uh when a client is uh how much of an input of a client is important or uh required when you're doing a project in the initial when we're onboarding a client we get all the feedback possible once we start our process of course every step of the way we asked you which plan works for you if we're presenting three plans maybe t one makes sense for you one makes sense for me that's not like your right and I'm wrong or vice versa so we we do guide them every step of the way but if halfway through the creative process someone has sent us you know 50 Pinterest images that's just disruptive to the entire process so we tell our clients if you want an extra week to collate all your thoughts of creatively the direction you would like it to head in you tell us in advance but once the process starts then you just let us keep going on that path otherwise it becomes you know two steps forward one step back and then we just keep getting stuck in a loop right and especially now see uh if someone is you know doing up the house on their own uh probably they don't have a budget to hire someone professionally and right uh what tips do you have for people someone say for example they just want to furnish their homes right and they're doing a apartment A lot of people nowadays obviously you know Pinterest is the most common thing they see okay I want to do something like this right but they are not able to achieve it uh you know even after uh buying similar furniture and all what are your tips on doing up a space if someone is is is a complete uh you know uh layman in this field uh what would you say that you know please make sure these things are done right I think your contractor is equally important to the the designer you know so if you have a good contractor on board who will give you the right quality of wardrobes the right you know bathroom fittings just make sure the shell structure of your house makes sense and works if it's not a build a finished space because things like furniture and art and rugs you can change like this you know you don't like it you call your friend over who has a good design aesthetic and they're like why don't you try this this this and there's so many furniture stores here at every price point and budget you know you don't have to go only in the super high-end there's at every price point and budget there's so much available but I feel like the shell structure needs to be very good because if your bathroom's not working your kitchen cabinets suck your cupboards don't open and close properly your flooring has cracks in it those are non-negotiables or you know your ceiling lights are not good um that stuff we insist that people have a good shell and the loose things you can play around with now you know uh coming from a market like Bombay right uh it's I would say when it comes to Interior Design especially uh it's probably way more matured as a market than the I didn't realize that you know T but like now when I'm seeing my Indian clients like it's not that I thought India was backward I think India is the best and we're amazing at everything but I I also know what an international Place Dubai is so I was thinking that it's going to be a very similar Market but strangely enough I do feel like the Indian Cent are so evolved in terms of paying top dollar for design there's zero resistance but when we're trying to charge similar rates here people are like oh what really and I'm like what I thought like we would have no resistance at all you know yeah no because I feel that you know uh okay maybe architecturally when it comes to like Building architecture probably the freedom with the rules and regulations especially like a city from Bombay I'm from bomb so I can relate uh you know uh for an architect is not that much uh but when comes to Interior Design obviously there's complete freedom and when I see people's homes and the way they've done it and the way it's uh you know and I think it's more of a trend for a lot of people to always do up their houses uh which even I when I moved here initially I felt that's quite strange that you walk into a house and what flooring the developers given 10 years even in a the most Prime area such as downtown of palm you'll find still you know building is 18 years old but the flooring is same yeah that's surpris me as well because when we're seeing spaces you're like but wouldn't like in India when people are giving their Builder finish Apartments they rip it out rip it out instantly and put you know whatever they feel like putting but here that mentality is very different very different and now slowly slowly I think in the last 2 3 years okay people have started refurbishing and doing up but still it's not to the extent what you know we would do in uh India but I think a lot of it is because uh Dubai is a transitional place for me many you know people feel like I love it here I'm here for maybe 2 years 3 years then we'll see you know but in India people are there from generations and so their home is a statement of many things their family their culture their lineage their Heritage and for many generations to come are going to be appreciating their home so this is something I'm just realizing now like uh as we're you know going through this process that because Dubai is so transitional and that's probably why the restaurant and Commercial Market is so much more if you see the restaurant way Ahad of what Indian designers are I'm saying this as a restaurant designer myself you go to every restaurant here and you're like wow even normal Cafe you know where am I like this is amazing but I guess because the homes are transitional you know and restaurants do so well because everyone goes out irrespective of whether you're here for one year or 10 years you know so there people are spending um and they're investing in the design uh but I do feel like that's also changed since the pandemic because because a lot of people have settled down and that perception of Dubai being a place that's only transitional it is changing it's become a great place for families um it's a it's a great culture here um weather is so good for large chunks of the year except for summer it's really good so yeah maybe that market will start maturing as well that's great what are what what are your top three things you love about the buy I love the food okay I think that's I'm like a huge foodie so I love the food um I love the beach access you know like I feel like the beach culture is great like um I've been coming to Dubai since I was a little kid because my dad had a business for his business he had a lot of stuff in Dubai and at that point it was there never a beach culture it was like you know you know you're on the ocean but you're on a desert like you're not supposed to go to the beach and hang out your skin is going to burn off but like the amount of you know beach clubs and Beach things I really love and um the people I think they're such amazing people from so many different you know places I love it I really do like the which was the first project you did in the Buy the J Islands project and if you can just tell us a little more about it how big that was uh it was an 18,000 foot plot on which the house uh was there and then we did a bunch of extensions it was for an Indian couple um that were from Kolkata and Bangalore and um they had actually moved in the pandemic to Dubai thinking that it was just going to be short and then they loved it so much they never wanted to go back and then they ended up buying this house in JRA islands and um my client thought that I would never do a project outside of India but because she like liked and followed my work she messaged saying listen I know you don't do projects outside of India but will you do it in Dubai and I was like of course I love doing projects anywhere and that's how it started it was a great great experience we had lots of fun had a great time with my client and lots of learning like for example okay in India if I want to change tiles somewhere if I'm looking for a tile I call my guy at the tile shop and I say sorry I want this much tile and send it to me right away okay and here you know I I realized that tiles are only on order and I was like oh God I didn't realize you know that you have to wait like a month for the tiles to come like 3 weeks cuz they're getting imported from somewhere so there were so many learnings like that where we have to you know behave very differently in terms of how we plan the project out um but it was a very good learning experience yeah in terms of work culture what do you feel is different uh comparing India versus Dubai so um in India I think uh we have like obviously unbelievable Craftsman but there is a large gap in education between you know the contractors and then the labor so while the labor are highly skilled and they're very good at their job because of the gaps in communication that does boil down to you know educational levels it does take a lot more work in explaining and in Dubai I felt like it was much more systemized and process driven and so I found Contracting and execution way easier in Dubai um yeah in India we have to like really like crack the whip and go all the time and of course we work with amazing contractors in India as well but definitely Dubai I found easier forier Contracting cont yes yes and if what's your like like a dream project which you still are looking to do like you know you wish you get a chance to do something um I'm hoping uh that this year I'm doing a 30,000 foot mansion on the tip of the Palm okay that's great if anyone's listen this that has that called me definitely definitely no there a lot of warfront velas coming up I would love that because when I see what happens is when you go to any of these uh properties over here uh especially the high-end ones uh okay yes they're nice it's expensive material and uh you know because du buai is so much about brand so you find nice you know everything is branded it is nice like so many nice things yeah there's so amazing ones but when it comes to the style I think that you know there's something really different you know okay one house is on on a say like a gray and a white tone the others in a beig someone's used a dark finish but it's not something like I haven't seen this anywhere yeah and when you see like the Indian designers and the kind of work that's getting churned out it's absolutely mindboggling the kind of design work that's actually happening there in all areas and spaces so that's amazing but the one thing that I like about Dubai more than the food and the the people and the beaches is um the the lifestyle like because in Bombay for example if we paid 50 million um uh Dirhams we would get a 6 or 7,000 squ foot apartment definitely with an ocean view but it's an apartment and with some amenities and parking and whatever on a road which probably has some CHS right next to it and here at that same price you've got like a mansion on the water with like thousands of square feet of space and you're really living life King science yeah I mean it it does H you know when you spend that kind of money the value what you get is much more than as compared to Bombay yes and in Bombay for example if you even at the lower end of the spectrum if you were to buy like say a $2 million um apartment that's like a 500t apartment in South Bombay is for 2 million Dirhams and here you would get a very nice apartment with everything like absolutely everything and things like parking is just a given like for us yes is there parking I know because a lot of cents when you know they're from does it come with a parking yeah it comes with parking it's in our brains because we're so paranoid about parking we're like please please just give me parking like I'll do anything uh but just give me parking because we never get parking yes even a studio comes with the parking I know you guys are very spoiled with how many parking spots you all get so yeah you take it for granted but like it's so important where do you park your car where do you park your car no that's true that's true that's absolutely true because you know the value wise yes definitely you know you get much more for what you spend over year now uh how easy or difficult was it to set up uh over year for you so it took me like a year of talking to my partners um because um I realized that so so they have expertise in highend retail execution and we obviously bring the expertise and design plus the entire process so I just wasn't sure about whether I wanted to do do it and take this move because this is me really betting on my myself and taking that big move and saying yes I want to do it but I realized in Dubai you do have to have a physical presence you have to have the office you have to have the people you can't go back and forth uh it's not as easy to grow some people are doing it and managing very well I don't think that was the case for me I was not being able to you know grow and scale my business the way I would have liked to so it took me like a full year to set all of this up to think about it to get everything figured out and yeah we started talking last year in like November and now we're in September so it's been a long journey that's great that's great going ahead what's are you seeing any uh uh Trends which uh you know globally right in terms of design uh which you think is still missing in the buai um globally in design I don't know actually because I feel like there's so much of everything in Dubai um but I don't know like maybe like the The Bling Bling style is the Dubai style but I do feel like that that is really evolving and changing and people are liking a more subtle palette in many cases as well um but um I think globally people are moving away from things that like they're moving towards quiet luxury yes and Dubai is the opposite of quiet luxury it's like the loudest luxury you can have like it has to say like fendy fendy fendy fendy you know um so I wonder whether given the Dubai lifestyle that people are going to be able to move towards quiet luxury because uh having that lifestyle is such a big part of the culture here um I don't know I guess that would be it if you were to choose between a branded furniture and a custom built furniture what would be your choice custom any day I think we're too like hardwired because I can get exactly the proportions and the depth and the hardness and the softness that I want right um but when it comes to specific brands of sofas the kind of like technology that they have in their forming I would definitely invest in those but as an overall question custom always custom always and do you think that you know uh in terms of quality uh a custom buil versus a say a branded Furniture is there any difference sometimes yes when you go to that very I I really do feel like for sofas for beds I'm not so sure okay because it's a framework and a backing and I feel like you know beds side tables things like that but the foam density and the quality of the foam a lot of these are proprietary Technologies to those specific high-end Brands so um you know if you're looking at like a t sofa or Minot sofa some of those are just so comfortable when you sit on it or like backers is one of my favorite sofas to sit on you sit on it I feel like I'll go to sleep in like a minute I don't think anyone could emulate that which is probably why there's so much longevity for them why people still buy um but yeah okay that's great now one last question for you s yes right uh you're a star on social media uh you're also a mom uh how do you effectively manage your time between work family kids what's the secret recipe okay so this is like a multipronged answer the first is like I'm very particular with time management okay I have like a hard like my day is mapped out like it's like Tetris bricks everything is super tightly packed in um I also have a very hard cut off time for switching on from work and switching off from work so I switch on at 9:00 I switch off at 6:00 okay even at 6:30 if someone asks me for something my brain has switched off and all I want to do is hang out with my kids I'm very clear with all my clients about this as well I also

    Here's the transcript of the video: [hey guys welcome to a brand new episode of the Dubai real estate podcast I'm your host tah maiia today I'm really excited for this episode because joining with me on the show is SAR sham the founder of asa's atellier from Bombay who' just set up a new Venture in Dubai they've just opened up their shop in Dubai and I'm really excited because she's one of the top leading interior designers of India who's coming to Dubai and I've been following her work for a very long time I really love what they've been doing and so for that reason I thought why not have on the show to discuss what's going on you know what are the interior design Trends going on how can someone really enhance their spaces etc etc guys before I start the show if you're watching this on

don't you start with a quick introduction on what do you do and a little more about yourself thank you so much for having me tah my name is Sarah I run an interior design studio called Isa aelia uh we've been around for about it's a fourth generation brand called Isa 30 Years of Legacy uh we have been around as an independent Design Studio doing the most luxury interior design spaces for about 10 years now in India and recently branched out to having our own office in Dubai under a bana called Gia oh wow that's great that's great so what uh got you to Dubai why Dubai I think that the Dubai Market is in desperate need of the off the services that we're offering and uh the way we do things is very very different and I can see that it's a booming market and there's a lot of demand here and so I want a piece of that pie that's great that's great so you know you just mentioned right now the things which are being different yeah so what do you what is it that you guys do differently as compared to say anyone else uh over here so I think the first offering is that it's super super customized okay we have absolutely the best sourcing in India and so whether it is curtains fabric upholstery embroidery hand knotted rugs uh completely custom crafted Furniture we can literally put everything into container and bring it to Dubai Dubai as we know doesn't manufacture a lot as U they import a lot of stuff and India being a country that has massive manufacturing capacity I feel like uh the kind of customization that we bring into our projects it is just not done here not to the extent that we do it we customize every thread every light every piece of everything you know every ergonomic height of everything is customized and also the process for us is very different we start from be shell and we do not leave till the glass toothbrush and toothpaste and bathroom hook and toilet paper holders placed on site so in Dubai I'm feeling like it's a very fragmented way of working where there's like you know you can get these design proposals then you're supposed to go shopping around to a contractor and get it made yourself um that endtoend service is not there in the way that we offer it and we also have a lot of project management that's built into what we already offer um so yeah I think it's a very very different offering okay and when you talk about you know uh the services you'll offer so is it only interior design or what are the services exactly uh your company would offer so it's uh conceptualization um all of the working drawings material selections definitely the interior designing part of it and then as well as the entire execution piece of it in terms of project management so we'll budget track we'll find the right contractors we'll find you the best vendors and makers and collaborators and artists to work with on the project and uh we'll be there with you from start to finish so it's literally an endtoend handholding service yeah now you know you Al right you said you know you do a lot of manufacturing everything obviously India is one of you know uh the biggest manufacturing hubs uh around the world uh how much of a difference does it make uh cost-wise if someone was to buy something here or get the same thing done over here yeah I know that obviously you know there's certain things which when you manufacture in India forget whether you get it done here but the quality is far better yeah okay uh but apart that how much of a difference does it put in cost um so this is we're not doing it for theost cost we're doing it for the quality but I will answer your question and say it's way cheaper so if we're looking at a hand knotted rug uh when we had we've actually completed an 18,000 foot J Islands Mansion already and uh when we were doing that and we went to the stores shopping around for rugs the quality of rugs and the kns per square inch that were there in the rugs compared to what we can do in India for a completely customized hand kned rug uh after shipping it and with the you know import duties and the rest of all of it and putting it all on container it was at half the price so and my client got literally exactly the right size shape design we've selected every every last thread and the same applies for curtains for some reason curtains here are very very expensive and uh you know I mean not for some reason we we know what the reasons are is because in India we manufacture everything so strangely enough it was cheaper for me to fly down my best curtain consultant from Dubai uh from India to Dubai measure the entire space hand embroider and custom make all the curtains in the highest quality of linen silk satin with the best thread workor and then come here and fly two of her installers and install it still at a significantly Less Price Right and much better quality way better quality and the other thing that I noticed in Dubai is that there are like a lot of cookie Cara houses you know so you have these large developments where the builders and the developers have made all the homes look the same and then in these developments there are designers who are doing 20 Villas that again all look similar you know so we we don't do that in India at all that's not the model in which we work with so for example we're doing seven apartments in one building um it's like a very very highend building like 50 million Dirhams an apartment okay however between the two apartments you would not even be able to guess that the same designer is doing it because everything is so different you know so we don't have any standards set of everything so that's the part that I find surprising about this Market is that people actually have the money but why would you want a cookie Cara house when you can actually you know get something that's so much more above and beyond and U we've presented to a bunch of people this is my first time presenting for my Dubai brand with my new partnership with Abra and U the response has been phenomenal people are like absolutely no one is doing this here so we're very positive and feel like um yeah we're going to do well in this market no no that's that's great no what you said is absolutely right there's you know there are a lot of people a lot of uh things but uh you know everyone is looking at cutting Corners just finishing the job and as you said you know uh even multi-million dollar homes sometimes you go into a community and they all look the same yeah in India uh definitely especially you know City like Bombay uh if two houses look the same nobody's going to buy it absolutely not even if they're the same family they still want it uh you know so that that's the part that's like I really wonder like you're spending 50 million 80 million on buying the house but you're okay with it looking like everything else in the community like how does that make sense or you're okay shopping from all the same stores all the same Brands as everyone else after you spent all that money why you know you there's so many better and more different options that are available out there and uh that's what we're hoping to bring all right now so tell me more about you know uh you you've built this company over the past uh decade and uh you know you're the principal architect how has your journey been like if if someone today because there are a lot of people who want to get into uh this field of interior design architecture right uh how's your journey been um it's been a journey uh lots and lots and lots of ups and downs so initially when I started out while we do have the family Legacy and Company I was very clear that I wanted to do this on my own so I didn't use any of my dad's contacts or any of the family Connections in order to get my first few clients um I did work with him for 5 years and then he would tell me like listen you know XYZ person is making this house and this space and why don't you but I was like no I'm going to find my own clients so initial years were very hard tah um I used to do only single bathroom projects single bedroom projects um I got shouted at a lot it's not a glamorous job uh most days are standing on site getting shouted at by clients so I really like clawed my way to where I am at right now and so I don't take anything lightly I don't take anything for granted um and yeah I feel like my Journey's Just Begun I have a long way to go and I'm looking forward to everything to come but if you if you look back 10 years right what were the key things uh you would say you did right and what would probably if you could change if you go if you could go back and change some things what would that be so I actually had 12 jobs before I was an interior designer yeah so I used to be a news Anor at Bloomberg which is why a setup like this seems very familiar for me um I used to work as an art consultant I have worked at a hedge fund I've worked at all kinds of jobs I worked at um saffronart I worked at uh Vogue um I was an intern there when they were launching the magazine I worked um at GRE Global the advertising agency so essentially I tried out a lot of jobs and I sucked at all of them I was really really bad and then I went back to working with my dad during which time a client told me uh listen you have a very good eye why don't you try interior design and I had already failed so many times that I felt like okay what's the worst that can happen but when I tried interior design irrespective of all the hardships I literally felt like you know like the Angels were singing the Red Sea had parted everything had aligned for me like literally everything had aligned because I was like wow I love it and I'm so good at it so I think uh what really worked in the Plus for me um what I would always do again and again is try everything and keep at it because I feel like I learned not just what I like but what I don't like so then when that thing it's like you know kissing many frogs to find your prince I did exactly that um for my career and if I had to look back and say the one thing that I would not have done again is that I think I said yes to everything you know I would have just said no a lot more so I was so desperate for work that I used to say yes to every project every client even if I felt like it wasn't a match for me and that ended up in either unhappy clients or I was unhappy or projects that didn't turn out the way I wanted to and I feel like I was always better off with less clients and less projects but the good ones good ones true so now I'm at that point where I'm like listen I will wait I will look around I'll find the right person the right project the right clientele for me I'm not in a hurry to have some certain number of XY Z I'm better focused on the quality people who respect me people who speak nicely to me people who respect us creatively and who are nice to deal with and work with yeah that's great that's great to know now tell me something you know uh when it is say something a a job like yours where uh it's every project has to be different or you know this thing how does this creativity actually come out like is it is there somewhere you take inspiration from or is it uh like you know different concepts in the mind my team so we start with the clients um we're very client Centric so uh we actually don't think we have a set signature style if you are the client we'd be like listen what's your style what do you like and then you'll tell us okay I like I don't know like beige with a touch of gold okay and then within that then we'll explore an as a team brainstorm concept and genuinely blessed with a very very creative team and so because we allow creative freedom to everyone in our studio that's how the outcomes are so different because everyone is kind of you know chipping in their two cents and uh that's how each project turns out how it does it's truly collaborative yeah that's great now when it comes to uh you know uh like you said previously you know when you see homes in Dubai what are the trends you feel that uh are not or the type of material you don't get to see here uh which probably you would probably want to do so what I do see a lot is like these very neutral spaces and beiges you know I see a lot of them with like an aak W and neutral tones and that's actually a beautiful aesthetic I don't think there's anything wrong with that aesthetic but I just feel like I wish people played with color a bit more that did spaces that were more colorful and I feel like in this attempt for everyone to like look cool and fit in they losing their own individuality right and so I would love to see spaces that are like weird funky conceptual and um I I feel like there are a lot of homes that all look derivative and similar yeah okay now uh also uh you know when you see nowadays especially when uh you see developer homes being handed over and especially apartments or even Villas town houses as cost or prices are going up most Developers or you know are going small in sizes right as a designer what would you advise if there's a small space okay and someone wants to still you know make sure there's complete what what what are your tips on doing up a place which is small so we've all I'm from Bombay uh my one of my early projects was like a 700 Square fo two bedroomroom Hall and kitchen for a family of three with four cats so I think no is too small for me I'm totally open-minded and for all of us in Bombay like a 2,000t apartment it's considered a palace okay so here what you guys consider small is relatively very reasonably sized for a Bombay person but having said that I think what we've realized um from living in smaller spaces is multi-use Furniture is the name of the game you have to have you know a dressing table that doubles up as a desk um a dining table that can fold out when there's more guest a sof that has hidden storage underneath um you know a partition that can close off and a separate room is created things like that that allow you to use the space in multiple ways and not you're not just stuck using it as is and the other thing is like guest rooms the one thing we tell our clients is that a lot of people live for parties and guest rooms okay so they said when we have a party where will people sit and then we ask our clients how often do you have a party in your house and they' be like at least once a month month I'm like cool okay so there's 12 months in the year so even if I say 15 days so of 365 days You're Building something that for 350 days of the year is not going to make sense to you so don't oh like the guest every year my sister comes and stays with me for 2 weeks okay now I I love that I'm very close to my family but don't build your whole home for those for those you know build it for your everyday functionality and for the odd occurrence is you know have a backup have a solution of course but don't compromise every day right for once in a while got it yeah when you look at a space okay what's the first thing you think about light okay ceiling height um energy that's great that's great and what are the trends you're seeing now going ahead what do you think the next you know uh four five years what kind of Trends will we see more when it comes to interior designs I feel like because Dubai is such an international place I think people of so many nationalities are coming in and trying all kinds of they're openminded to new and different things and I definitely see it with the commercial design with the restaurant design it's unbelievable I mean some of the restaurants some of the retail stores are so good and some of the designers doing them are unreal I mean way way ahead and doing some superb things so I feel like I'm going to see I'm hoping to see that happen in the residential space as well by the way we do Residential plan commercial spaces we don't only do Residential when it comes to uh Dubai what was what's your uh main focus going to be as a company client is happy that's the main focus that's our main focus in all across life is maintain the relationship with the client client should be happy all else takes uh back seat so it's super client focused very good and you know uh as you mentioned that when you meet a client the client's brief or you know is there but at the same time you know uh from someone coming from a creative background how do you face the challenges when sometimes you want to do something creatively but the client is not really aligned or is not able to Envision that because I mean from a real estate aspect I see this a lot of times that there are a lot of people no matter how many flow plans you explain them or whatever but they want to see the space okay they can't really Envision or or imagine how that place is going to be so how do you deal with challenges like that because I'm sure you must be facing this so I actually feel really bad because I know that they're genuinely wanting to understand how the space looks but they're just not able to and it's very frustrating for them as well because they're like but I can't understand you know so in scenarios like that we usually have an early conversation where we're like are you good at visualizing spaces are you not and if they say we really struggle with visualizing we try and give them as many tools as as possible obviously 3D views physical samples but also tell them at an early stage that you have to let go a little bit and there has to be a large element of trust with us as your designers that I may not be able to 100% understand how this is going to look but I trust that my designer will get me you know to that end point and that this is going to make sense so um I think just letting go a little bit goes a long way okay and uh you know uh when a client is uh how much of an input of a client is important or uh required when you're doing a project in the initial when we're onboarding a client we get all the feedback possible once we start our process of course every step of the way we asked you which plan works for you if we're presenting three plans maybe t one makes sense for you one makes sense for me that's not like your right and I'm wrong or vice versa so we we do guide them every step of the way but if halfway through the creative process someone has sent us you know 50 Pinterest images that's just disruptive to the entire process so we tell our clients if you want an extra week to collate all your thoughts of creatively the direction you would like it to head in you tell us in advance but once the process starts then you just let us keep going on that path otherwise it becomes you know two steps forward one step back and then we just keep getting stuck in a loop right and especially now see uh if someone is you know doing up the house on their own uh probably they don't have a budget to hire someone professionally and right uh what tips do you have for people someone say for example they just want to furnish their homes right and they're doing a apartment A lot of people nowadays obviously you know Pinterest is the most common thing they see okay I want to do something like this right but they are not able to achieve it uh you know even after uh buying similar furniture and all what are your tips on doing up a space if someone is is is a complete uh you know uh layman in this field uh what would you say that you know please make sure these things are done right I think your contractor is equally important to the the designer you know so if you have a good contractor on board who will give you the right quality of wardrobes the right you know bathroom fittings just make sure the shell structure of your house makes sense and works if it's not a build a finished space because things like furniture and art and rugs you can change like this you know you don't like it you call your friend over who has a good design aesthetic and they're like why don't you try this this this and there's so many furniture stores here at every price point and budget you know you don't have to go only in the super high-end there's at every price point and budget there's so much available but I feel like the shell structure needs to be very good because if your bathroom's not working your kitchen cabinets suck your cupboards don't open and close properly your flooring has cracks in it those are non-negotiables or you know your ceiling lights are not good um that stuff we insist that people have a good shell and the loose things you can play around with now you know uh coming from a market like Bombay right uh it's I would say when it comes to Interior Design especially uh it's probably way more matured as a market than the I didn't realize that you know T but like now when I'm seeing my Indian clients like it's not that I thought India was backward I think India is the best and we're amazing at everything but I I also know what an international Place Dubai is so I was thinking that it's going to be a very similar Market but strangely enough I do feel like the Indian Cent are so evolved in terms of paying top dollar for design there's zero resistance but when we're trying to charge similar rates here people are like oh what really and I'm like what I thought like we would have no resistance at all you know yeah no because I feel that you know uh okay maybe architecturally when it comes to like Building architecture probably the freedom with the rules and regulations especially like a city from Bombay I'm from bomb so I can relate uh you know uh for an architect is not that much uh but when comes to Interior Design obviously there's complete freedom and when I see people's homes and the way they've done it and the way it's uh you know and I think it's more of a trend for a lot of people to always do up their houses uh which even I when I moved here initially I felt that's quite strange that you walk into a house and what flooring the developers given 10 years even in a the most Prime area such as downtown of palm you'll find still you know building is 18 years old but the flooring is same yeah that's surpris me as well because when we're seeing spaces you're like but wouldn't like in India when people are giving their Builder finish Apartments they rip it out rip it out instantly and put you know whatever they feel like putting but here that mentality is very different very different and now slowly slowly I think in the last 2 3 years okay people have started refurbishing and doing up but still it's not to the extent what you know we would do in uh India but I think a lot of it is because uh Dubai is a transitional place for me many you know people feel like I love it here I'm here for maybe 2 years 3 years then we'll see you know but in India people are there from generations and so their home is a statement of many things their family their culture their lineage their Heritage and for many generations to come are going to be appreciating their home so this is something I'm just realizing now like uh as we're you know going through this process that because Dubai is so transitional and that's probably why the restaurant and Commercial Market is so much more if you see the restaurant way Ahad of what Indian designers are I'm saying this as a restaurant designer myself you go to every restaurant here and you're like wow even normal Cafe you know where am I like this is amazing but I guess because the homes are transitional you know and restaurants do so well because everyone goes out irrespective of whether you're here for one year or 10 years you know so there people are spending um and they're investing in the design uh but I do feel like that's also changed since the pandemic because because a lot of people have settled down and that perception of Dubai being a place that's only transitional it is changing it's become a great place for families um it's a it's a great culture here um weather is so good for large chunks of the year except for summer it's really good so yeah maybe that market will start maturing as well that's great what are what what are your top three things you love about the buy I love the food okay I think that's I'm like a huge foodie so I love the food um I love the beach access you know like I feel like the beach culture is great like um I've been coming to Dubai since I was a little kid because my dad had a business for his business he had a lot of stuff in Dubai and at that point it was there never a beach culture it was like you know you know you're on the ocean but you're on a desert like you're not supposed to go to the beach and hang out your skin is going to burn off but like the amount of you know beach clubs and Beach things I really love and um the people I think they're such amazing people from so many different you know places I love it I really do like the which was the first project you did in the Buy the J Islands project and if you can just tell us a little more about it how big that was uh it was an 18,000 foot plot on which the house uh was there and then we did a bunch of extensions it was for an Indian couple um that were from Kolkata and Bangalore and um they had actually moved in the pandemic to Dubai thinking that it was just going to be short and then they loved it so much they never wanted to go back and then they ended up buying this house in JRA islands and um my client thought that I would never do a project outside of India but because she like liked and followed my work she messaged saying listen I know you don't do projects outside of India but will you do it in Dubai and I was like of course I love doing projects anywhere and that's how it started it was a great great experience we had lots of fun had a great time with my client and lots of learning like for example okay in India if I want to change tiles somewhere if I'm looking for a tile I call my guy at the tile shop and I say sorry I want this much tile and send it to me right away okay and here you know I I realized that tiles are only on order and I was like oh God I didn't realize you know that you have to wait like a month for the tiles to come like 3 weeks cuz they're getting imported from somewhere so there were so many learnings like that where we have to you know behave very differently in terms of how we plan the project out um but it was a very good learning experience yeah in terms of work culture what do you feel is different uh comparing India versus Dubai so um in India I think uh we have like obviously unbelievable Craftsman but there is a large gap in education between you know the contractors and then the labor so while the labor are highly skilled and they're very good at their job because of the gaps in communication that does boil down to you know educational levels it does take a lot more work in explaining and in Dubai I felt like it was much more systemized and process driven and so I found Contracting and execution way easier in Dubai um yeah in India we have to like really like crack the whip and go all the time and of course we work with amazing contractors in India as well but definitely Dubai I found easier forier Contracting cont yes yes and if what's your like like a dream project which you still are looking to do like you know you wish you get a chance to do something um I'm hoping uh that this year I'm doing a 30,000 foot mansion on the tip of the Palm okay that's great if anyone's listen this that has that called me definitely definitely no there a lot of warfront velas coming up I would love that because when I see what happens is when you go to any of these uh properties over here uh especially the high-end ones uh okay yes they're nice it's expensive material and uh you know because du buai is so much about brand so you find nice you know everything is branded it is nice like so many nice things yeah there's so amazing ones but when it comes to the style I think that you know there's something really different you know okay one house is on on a say like a gray and a white tone the others in a beig someone's used a dark finish but it's not something like I haven't seen this anywhere yeah and when you see like the Indian designers and the kind of work that's getting churned out it's absolutely mindboggling the kind of design work that's actually happening there in all areas and spaces so that's amazing but the one thing that I like about Dubai more than the food and the the people and the beaches is um the the lifestyle like because in Bombay for example if we paid 50 million um uh Dirhams we would get a 6 or 7,000 squ foot apartment definitely with an ocean view but it's an apartment and with some amenities and parking and whatever on a road which probably has some CHS right next to it and here at that same price you've got like a mansion on the water with like thousands of square feet of space and you're really living life King science yeah I mean it it does H you know when you spend that kind of money the value what you get is much more than as compared to Bombay yes and in Bombay for example if you even at the lower end of the spectrum if you were to buy like say a $2 million um apartment that's like a 500t apartment in South Bombay is for 2 million Dirhams and here you would get a very nice apartment with everything like absolutely everything and things like parking is just a given like for us yes is there parking I know because a lot of cents when you know they're from does it come with a parking yeah it comes with parking it's in our brains because we're so paranoid about parking we're like please please just give me parking like I'll do anything uh but just give me parking because we never get parking yes even a studio comes with the parking I know you guys are very spoiled with how many parking spots you all get so yeah you take it for granted but like it's so important where do you park your car where do you park your car no that's true that's true that's absolutely true because you know the value wise yes definitely you know you get much more for what you spend over year now uh how easy or difficult was it to set up uh over year for you so it took me like a year of talking to my partners um because um I realized that so so they have expertise in highend retail execution and we obviously bring the expertise and design plus the entire process so I just wasn't sure about whether I wanted to do do it and take this move because this is me really betting on my myself and taking that big move and saying yes I want to do it but I realized in Dubai you do have to have a physical presence you have to have the office you have to have the people you can't go back and forth uh it's not as easy to grow some people are doing it and managing very well I don't think that was the case for me I was not being able to you know grow and scale my business the way I would have liked to so it took me like a full year to set all of this up to think about it to get everything figured out and yeah we started talking last year in like November and now we're in September so it's been a long journey that's great that's great going ahead what's are you seeing any uh uh Trends which uh you know globally right in terms of design uh which you think is still missing in the buai um globally in design I don't know actually because I feel like there's so much of everything in Dubai um but I don't know like maybe like the The Bling Bling style is the Dubai style but I do feel like that that is really evolving and changing and people are liking a more subtle palette in many cases as well um but um I think globally people are moving away from things that like they're moving towards quiet luxury yes and Dubai is the opposite of quiet luxury it's like the loudest luxury you can have like it has to say like fendy fendy fendy fendy you know um so I wonder whether given the Dubai lifestyle that people are going to be able to move towards quiet luxury because uh having that lifestyle is such a big part of the culture here um I don't know I guess that would be it if you were to choose between a branded furniture and a custom built furniture what would be your choice custom any day I think we're too like hardwired because I can get exactly the proportions and the depth and the hardness and the softness that I want right um but when it comes to specific brands of sofas the kind of like technology that they have in their forming I would definitely invest in those but as an overall question custom always custom always and do you think that you know uh in terms of quality uh a custom buil versus a say a branded Furniture is there any difference sometimes yes when you go to that very I I really do feel like for sofas for beds I'm not so sure okay because it's a framework and a backing and I feel like you know beds side tables things like that but the foam density and the quality of the foam a lot of these are proprietary Technologies to those specific high-end Brands so um you know if you're looking at like a t sofa or Minot sofa some of those are just so comfortable when you sit on it or like backers is one of my favorite sofas to sit on you sit on it I feel like I'll go to sleep in like a minute I don't think anyone could emulate that which is probably why there's so much longevity for them why people still buy um but yeah okay that's great now one last question for you s yes right uh you're a star on social media uh you're also a mom uh how do you effectively manage your time between work family kids what's the secret recipe okay so this is like a multipronged answer the first is like I'm very particular with time management okay I have like a hard like my day is mapped out like it's like Tetris bricks everything is super tightly packed in um I also have a very hard cut off time for switching on from work and switching off from work so I switch on at 9:00 I switch off at 6:00 okay even at 6:30 if someone asks me for something my brain has switched off and all I want to do is hang out with my kids I'm very clear with all my clients about this as well I also never work weekends ever ever ever ever that is dedicated time with my kids now the other side of that I have two nannies I have my mother and my mother-in-law who are full-time with me they stay very close to my house and I'm very blessed with an equal partner and my husband husband so it is very much like a village that is raising these kids um I feel like as moms there is an hus on you but I don't feel like that pressure is always there because so many people are sharing the load with me right that's great that's great I think s that was a great great conversation I really uh you know enjoyed it thank you so much for your time and I uh wish you all the best uh you know for your uh you know new uh Venture in duai and uh I hope uh you know I could probably uh you know probably collaborate on some project

10 hours ago,N8ED5y6mZic,Important Update For New Investors | Wali Khan English,walikhanenglish,"so although I'm making this video a bit late but it does not matter as the impact of interest rate decrease or increase won't happen in a day or even in a week a few days back Federal Reserve Bank in the US has cut interest rate and the banks all over the UAE have been proactively cutting their own offered profit rates so I received this email from VI bank which informed me on 31st of August that they are reducing the rates from 5% to 4.25% on regular savings space while fed announced this on 18th of September so you can imagine they have already announced 18 days prior to the announcement so this is the same what has happened with other Financial institutes as well Bo is not the only platform who has acted proactively in fact all the financial institutes which provide fixed income opportunities have changed their offerings if you talk about UAE national bonds or any other bank who has fixed income products be it Sharia compliant or they have conventional options they all were impacted moreover as Durham and USD are packed with each other any profit or interest rates offered in the UAE always move in tandom to whatever the policy is taken by the FED in the US now let's talk about how it's going to impact a common man and talk about some benefits to you as a consumer a regular consumer will get benefit on low mortgage low credit card interest low car payments and low personal loan and so on and so forth there are many other benefits that the regular consumer will have one once the interest rates are cut in short as a consumer it's much easier for you to borrow money to spend on whatever you want this sometimes have a direct impact on inflation as well as this is one of the reason we had record inflation in last few years when the interest rates were low let's not delve deep into this direction as there are multiple other factors involved in this video I would like to talk about more people who have been enjoying these high interest rates and avoiding riskier investing Avenues in the hope that the party will keep on going now this is where educating yourself with investing is very important in such times where interest rates are low the guaranteed income opportunities die up just like V bank V bank has reduced the interest rates from 6% a few few months back it was 6% and now it's 4.25% you never know the next step might be 3.5% and based on whatever fed uh announces they would be of course proactive in reducing their rates just six months back everyone was able to invest in fixed Securities with very high interest rates of in the range of let's say 6% 7% or even sometimes at 8% now those people will be in a fix because if they were only reliant on fixed income they would not be able to invest anymore with such kind of rate of return this is where educating yourself with investing is very important in such times where the interest rates are low the guaranteed income opportunities would show dry up so we should start thinking seriously about asset as opposed to people who are hooked with high interest rate instruments assets can be stocks real estate and investing on your own self now investing on your own self is very important I've seen myself that when I started like four years back making these videos on YouTube it has changed my life completely but let's talk about only intangible Investments opportunities which are stocks real estate and fixed income as well by the way there is still opportunity for people who want to have lowrisk investment because lowrisk investment is still uh very important um let's say if you need some money after 3 years and you don't want to have it invested in a stock market or let's say real estate because of course once you invest in for a short period of time the market can go down uh the real estate can probably not get liquidated or things things can happen so for that you still need fixed income so I'll tell you about those fixed income option in uh towards the end of the video but let's talk about stocks first I'll show you one of the chart this is very interesting and once you see this you will have an idea that why it's important in investing in the stocks in low rate environment from 1929 until July 2019 uh we've got a lot of instances where the interest rates have been cut down and this chart is showing you S&P 500 return for the 12 months after the rate cut in 20 2019 after the 12 months the return on the S&P 500 was 3.3% similarly in February 1954 the return once the interest rates were cut was 35% and so on and so forth only two instances were there in January 2001 and September 2007 the great uh recession when we saw that the the the cut of interest rate still did not increase the returns in the next 12 months so although I would say this is still not something which you should uh be banking on and you should be taking this uh data with the pinch of salt but still this is something which is available and this uh data shows you that the lower interest rates will give you a boost in the stock market again it's not an investment advice but it's just the data points that I wanted to share for the stock market there are options in ETFs um the individual stocks as well as there are some Robo invest me platforms if you're watching me from the GCC countries there are uh options like surva there are platforms like Baraka and also u a universal platform like Interactive Broker that you can open the account and start uh investing platforms like surva and Baraka they are very easy to go uh easy to use platform uh the reason is that they are based in the UAE and once you are funding the account the support is Al also here so it's easier uh for you to talk to them uh to get some support but a good platform which is Interactive Broker that is based in the US once you want to let's say get into support with them you have to call them you have to have some kind of email correspondence which is having friction so if you are starting up I would suggest you to have some kind of broker like surva or Baraka but if you are having good enough experience then you can go ahead with Interactive Broker as well now with surva or Baraka you have ETFs and individual stocks as well we you can invest I won't recommend anyone who is starting up uh to go for individual stocks because it's very difficult to pick individual stocks once you don't have enough knowledge ETFs are uh easy uh they are basically broad Market uh collection of the stocks itself there are different ETFs uh that there are available uh that you can invest in there is uh uh V vti and these kind of uh stock um ETF stocks that uh are tracking the whole Market there is another option which is Robo investor platform uh this is offered by Brokers like surva uh I won't say broker surva is not a broker surva is basically a platform uh surva is using at the back end there there are some other Brokers for for them to use you can tell them your risk profile uh you can tell them that okay I'm going to invest in low risk um options which of course will have lower return as well or you can tell them that you have higher risk um appetite and you can have higher return as well there again this this is not an investment advice but you have to think about yourself how you investing I would suggest everyone who is uh investing in surva to go for higher risk the reason is that for myself whatever investment I'm doing it's on a smaller level or let's say it's it's not the big percentage of my net worth so I can take more risk while investing in surva similarly Baraka doesn't have any Robo investor platform but they have option to invest in ETFs and IND individual stocks then comes Interactive Broker they also have the similar kind of opportunities but at the same time they have an ETF which can give you the opportunity to invest and get um tax benefit because when whenever you are investing in ETFs or stocks from the UAE or being a non US citizen you will always be slapped with 30% of dividend tax let's say if you you've invested $100 and you've got $3 of dividends those $3 would be slapped with the 30% tax on dividend but there is an option in Interactive Broker that if you buy Irish domicile ETF you would only be taxed on 15% but again as I said Interactive Broker is a bit difficult and also it has more complications while you're opening the account while you're transferring the money while you're investing in it if you want I can make another video about Interactive Broker only you have to let me know in the comments so for uh Baraka and surva if you want to open the account you can use my referral code which is linked in the description below uh and you can get $50 for Sera and up to $25 for Baraka once you start trading with those platforms the terms and condition are mentioned in the description of this video now before I go to the next section which is real estate I just wanted to touch upon uh reads because you can buy reads while you are in your brokerage platform like SVA Baraka or Interactive Broker uh REITs are basically Real Estate Investment Trust where uh they are listed on the stock market and you can buy them and trade them uh day in day out on the stock market although I don't recommend day uh day trading any anyways but just to let you know that you can do this now reads are specifically good because then you have a real estate exposure not by investing in direct real estate so I invest through Baraka in reality income which is a good read I again it's not a advice from my end but it's almost having 5% of uh uh dividend returns uh on top of that there is a price appreciation which it which which I've seen from 45 to uh $62 although during 2017 the same read was almost around $70 so it all depends on you if you want to go ahead with investing you should go otherwise you should stick with uh simple Index Fund now comes the uh actual real estate that you can buy if you're in Dubai you can buy through cash you can buy through mortgage you can buy through uh let's say Off plan properties so there are many other options to invest in Dubai real estate once you plan to buy a property it comes at a higher cost even if you're going for a mortgage it at least you have to go for 20% down payment so 1 million dham property would at least require you to have 20 uh 200,000 dams and then on top of that you might need the uh property acquisition cost which is around 7% nowadays the second option is the fractional ownership I invest through stake and smart crowd for the fractional ownership in UAE properties these are very good platforms they are regulated platforms they've got transparent set of rules that you can always see on their websites so what happens is that they've got some properties listed on their website and whatever amount you want to invest in let's say 1,000 dams 2,000 Dam 5,000 dams 10,000 dams or even 100,000 Dam you want to invest in you you can just go there fund your wallet through your uh bank card or let's say your uh let's say your uh card not credit card but debit card if you're not in the UA still you can invest through funds transfer these platforms actually are uh really secure because they are regulated by the competent Authority here in the UAE uh they have spvs that they create for each property if you want to see your own name against your SPV then you can go to the uh the DFC public register and you will find out that your name is there so that is why I'm really comfortable investing in these platforms if you want to invest you can use my referral code which is linked in the description below to get 200 or 250 dams of referal bonus when whenever you start investing in these platforms now as I said before that I want to discuss about fixed income which is still giving you some kind of return because uh sometimes you want to invest in shortterm let's say 3 years four years let's say you want to uh pay for your children education or let's say you want to buy a house and for that you want to uh save some money for the next 2 3 years that money cannot be invested in the stock market or even the real estate because then that money can have some short-term deviation and the funds can go down you can have negative returns so that is important to be invested in the fixed income the fixed income uh opportunity that I will be telling you is basically you can maximize your return based on the length of uh investment that you're doing so even for the R Bank the one-ear lock in period if you if you go for the one-ear lock in period you will get almost uh 4.5 or 5% return I'll mention on the screen but if you go for the shorter period or let's say the savings account that is giving you 4.25% so depending on your situation whenever you want the funds you can invest accordingly so there are different banks there are different platforms that are offering you uh different rates for one year 2 years let's say 1 month 3 years 5 years even So based on your needs based on your final outcome based on whatever your uh goals are you can invest on whatever tenure that you're looking for I make uh videos about personal finance I make videos about productivity I do podcast as well a recent uh podcast that I've done about side incomes almost 10 of them I've discussed with one of my friend Bah uh the link of this video is here there is another podcast that I've done with Ali he's the uh moderator of a very famous group here in the UAE uh about personal finance here is the video do let me know how did you like this video thanks a lot","You are a tech influencer known for your

    Now, create a Twitter thread based on this information in your style.","1/7 Have you heard the latest buzz? The Federal Reserve just cut interest rates, and banks in places like the UAE are following suit! This means big changes for consumers and investors alike. Let’s dive into the details!

2/7 With lower interest rates, everyday folks can say goodbye to sky-high mortgages, credit card rates, and personal loans. It’s a perfect time for borrowing! But here's the catch: lower rates can also affect things like inflation. So, it’s a double-edged sword!

3/7 For those who have been riding high on fixed-interest products, be prepared for a reality check! Rates on savings accounts are dropping (like that 5% to 4.25% shift from VI Bank). Relying solely on these won’t cut it anymore!

4/7 Now's the time to level up your investment game! Think stocks, real estate, and even investing in yourself! For example, when rates are low, stocks often thrive. Historical data shows S&P 500 returns can skyrocket following rate cuts!

5/7 If you're just starting out, consider platforms like Surva or Baraka, which offer easy access to ETFs and stocks. They simplify investing while providing robust support. Just be cautious - ETFs are often better than picking individual stocks!

6/7 Interested in real estate? Fractional ownership via platforms like Smart Crowd lets you invest in properties without breaking the bank! You can invest small amounts and still gain exposure to the real estate market. How cool is that?

7/7 Lastly, don’t ignore fixed-income options! They’re still valuable for short-term goals. Different banks offer various terms, so assess your needs carefully. Remember, investing is all about making informed decisions! Let’s keep learning and growing together!"
