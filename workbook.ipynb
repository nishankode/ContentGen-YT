      "4/7 And letâ€™s be real, this isn't just a one-off event. Complaints have been skyrocketing, with Ola seeing over 880,000 complaints monthly! Their service centers? Barely increased from 400 to 500. Customers are frustrated, and the heat is on.\n",

      "5/7 The government is stepping in! ðŸš¨ They're launching an investigation, which could really put Ola on the spot. With over 10,000 complaints filed, itâ€™s time for them to rise to the occasion and show they can handle customer grievances transparently.\n",
